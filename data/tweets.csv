Solana tanked to almost zero and somehow got rescued back. That‚Äôs not a free market, that‚Äôs an inside game. Some secret info before here üßµüëá

Look, the real issue with Solana isn‚Äôt just about reliability or speed. Yeah, sure, it suddenly went into ‚Äúslo mode‚Äù right when Trump coin started pumping and then collapsing, convenient timing, right? But that‚Äôs not the core problem.

The real issue is Firedancer. It was developed alongside Jump Crypto, a firm whose entire existence in traditional markets is about extracting money from retail players. And guess what? They‚Äôre doing the same thing here. Solana‚Äôs gas fees and speed don‚Äôt exist to help the average investor, they exist to give Jump Trading and other market makers an insane information advantage. Even if one individual trader doesn‚Äôt feel it, the net effect on the masses is pure extraction.

They hold a ridiculous edge over retail. And honestly? Speed doesn‚Äôt even matter for the average investor. Ethereum, on the other hand, is actually decentralized. The number of devs building on ETH completely outpaces Solana, and the competition in ETH‚Äôs L2 ecosystem is thriving. That‚Äôs healthy.

Solana, on the other hand? It‚Äôs been designed as a long-term extraction machine, just like how traditional financial markets work today. 62% of its tokens went straight into the hands of VCs and insiders. It‚Äôs just another version of Web2 big tech, where people are the product.

That said, for memecoins and AI agents, Solana does have the biggest market share. If you‚Äôre a degen looking for quick plays, it makes sense to be there. It‚Äôs just really up to you, do you want your money in centralized hands, or would you rather put it in something more decentralized like Ethereum?","""1899106984005394908""","37945701"
dotkrueger,"For the last two-three years we had to listen to Yellen and Powell insist that ""the economy was great"" and ""banks were incredibly strong"".

This was BS. Jobs numbers were being propped up by massive Government hires. Bank ""health"" was the result of ""innovative"" programs like the ""BTFP"", and ""paying depositors 0.1% while earning 5%"".

By now it should be clear to all thinking people that this was both a scam of epic proportions and a gross violation of human rights.

We‚Äôve never had a proper accounting of how and why this tyranny happened. 

Remember the videos of people dropping dead in the streets?  We now know they were fake. Remember the ‚Äúventilator shortages‚Äù?  Remember the hospital ships coming to relieve the ‚Äúfull‚Äù hospitals?  Remember the concerns of morgues overflowing?   All of it was a sham.   

The academics, the scientists, the NGOs, the politicians, the medical community - they were all wrong.  All wrong.  They censored and arrested those who stood against the tyranny as they violated human rights.   They were wrong both about the risk ‚Äî Covid was not nearly as deadly as they claimed, and they were wrong about the measures to deal with it.  No matter how deadly, it‚Äôs never legitimate for government to interfere with freedoms in this way. 

Now we should all look back and remember the tyranny and ask why this happened.  Most importantly we must make sure it never happens again.  No matter how deadly a virus the government does not have the right to override the risk preferences of an individual.   They‚Äôve tried to bring back the tyranny with ‚ÄúOmicron‚Äù and other efforts and the next pandemic of tyranny may be driven by something else entirely.

"0xNurstar","It's time for Interplanetary Scaling Explorations

During all these years I've always considered myself an Ethereum maximalist and I must admit that I was very skeptical when @StarkWareLtd announced developments about settling @Starknet on Bitcoin alongside Ethereum.

However, after diving deeper in the hard work of the Gigabrains from @StarkWareLtd and the 
@StarknetFndn, I now believe that this bidirectional approach is the right path to follow.

One of the things that made me fall in love with @Starknet and with @StarkWareLtd approach to scalability since the StarkEx early days was their originality and their experimental attitude in solving complex problems. 
They have been pioneers in the Ethereum scaling scene and I also think they even had to pay a very high price for their originality as some Ethereum OGs have always had a discriminating negative bias towards Starknet for not being EVM compatible. I personally never understood such behaviours and I believe that trying new, original approaches to solve problems is one of the most important core values of Ethereum and the whole Starknet community fully embraced this principle during these years.

The Ethereum L2 War1 is over and we are now entering a new age

Scaling on the Ethereum planet will remain one of the most exciting landscapes in this industry but it's now time for Interplanetary Scaling Explorations as well.

@Starknet maintains its feet well grounded on @ethereum while starting a new adventure, settling on Bitcoin and enabling next-gen scaling in the first and most successful Blockchain so far. 

Pioneering is a lifestyle for our community.

Let's keep on writing the History of Scaling together, my dear @Starknet fam!

‚ÄúI think the media is a driver of misinformation much more than the media would like to admit that they are.

In a lot of cases, it is the average citizen that knows more than the journalist. 

Very often, when I see an article about something that I know a lot about, they get a lot wrong.

It's the best interpretation of someone who doesn't really understand what's going on in the industry.

If somebody is actually an expert in the field, and was actually there and then writes about their experience, I think that's going to be better than a journalist.‚Äù

arndxt_xo,"Your Ultimate Yield Farming Guide on Sonic (Part 1)

1. Shadow DEX: Delta-Neutral S/stS Liquidity
2. Rings Protocol: Yield-Bearing Stablecoins
3. Vicuna Finance: Leveraged Concentrated Liquidity
4. Spectra Finance: Fixed-Rate Yield Vaults
5. Vertex Protocol: Perpetuals Yield Farming

üëáüëá

1. Shadow DEX: Delta-Neutral S/stS Liquidity

@ShadowOnSonic is a decentralized exchange providing liquidity pools with aggressive fee structures and high APR through concentrated liquidity.

Strategy: Provide liquidity to the S/stS pool (S is Sonic‚Äôs native token, stS is its staked version) in an aggressive price range, hedge spot S exposure with a short position on Hyperliquid, and stack Sonic Activity Points.

Estimated APR: ~116% (from liquidity provision) + Sonic points (16x multiplier for activity).

Steps:
‚Ä¢ Acquire $S and convert some into staked S $stS via Beethoven X.
‚Ä¢ Provide liquidity to the S/stS pool on Shadow DEX within a tight price range (¬±5% around market price).
‚Ä¢ Hedge price exposure by opening a 1x short position on S via Hyperliquid, neutralizing volatility.
‚Ä¢ Accumulate Sonic Activity Points (16x multiplier due to asset deployment).

Risks: Impermanent loss mitigated by hedging, smart contract vulnerabilities, hedging slippage.

2. Rings Protocol: Yield-Bearing Stablecoins

@Rings_Protocol issues scUSD, a yield-bearing stablecoin backed by collateral (USDC, ETH derivatives), generating yields from cross-chain deployments.

Strategy: Mint scUSD (Sonic-native stablecoin) by depositing stablecoins or ETH-based tokens, earning yield from Ethereum vaults via Veda, and redeploying scUSD for additional DeFi yields.

Estimated APR: ~10-20% (base yield from @veda_labs vaults, plus potential extra from scUSD deployment).

Steps:
‚Ä¢ Bridge or obtain USDC/WETH to Sonic.
‚Ä¢ Deposit collateral into Rings Protocol to mint scUSD (collateral earns yield via Ethereum-based Veda Labs vaults).
‚Ä¢ Stake minted scUSD on Sonic or provide it as liquidity to DEX pools.
‚Ä¢ Regularly collect yield distributed weekly by Rings.
‚Ä¢ Earn Sonic Points passively and actively (6x multiplier).

3. Vicuna Finance: Leveraged Concentrated Liquidity

@VicunaFinance provides leverage for concentrated liquidity provision, amplifying yields in stable pairs.

Strategy: Use borrowed funds to provide leveraged liquidity to a concentrated pool (e.g., USDC/scUSD), amplifying trading fee yields.

Estimated APR: ~40-60% (15% base APR √ó 3-4x leverage, before borrowing costs).

Steps:
‚Ä¢ Deposit USDC as collateral on Vicuna.
‚Ä¢ Leverage collateral (3-4x) to borrow additional stablecoins (scUSD or USDC).
‚Ä¢ Provide leveraged liquidity into a concentrated stablecoin pool on Shadow or Beethoven X.
‚Ä¢ Maintain collateral health and regularly harvest rewards.
‚Ä¢ Earn Sonic Points for active liquidity.

Risks: Leveraged liquidation risk, interest rate fluctuations, impermanent loss in volatile markets.

4. Spectra Finance: Fixed-Rate Yield Vaults

@spectra_finance offers predictable, fixed-rate returns on stablecoin deposits through yield vaults, ideal for stable, lower-risk returns.

Strategy: Lock stablecoins for a fixed-rate yield, hedge against yield volatility, and earn additional LP rewards.

Estimated APR: ~12-18% (fixed rate + liquidity provision incentives).

Steps:
‚Ä¢ Deposit stablecoins (USDC/scUSD) into Spectra's fixed-rate vaults, locking for durations (30‚Äì90 days).
‚Ä¢ Optionally, boost earnings by providing liquidity to Spectra‚Äôs interest rate trading pools.
‚Ä¢ Collect predictable yields plus Sonic Points for active participation.

Risks: Lower flexibility due to lock-ups, potential opportunity cost during high market volatility.

5. Vertex Protocol: Perpetuals Yield Farming

@vertex_protocol combines spot markets, perpetual trading, and lending markets, allowing users to earn interest on stablecoin deposits and yield from perpetual futures.

Strategy: Deposit stablecoins into Vertex‚Äôs money market to earn lending yield, then use borrowed funds to farm perpetuals trading rewards.

Estimated APR: ~15-25% (10% lending + 5-15% trading incentives).

Strategy Steps:
‚Ä¢ Deposit USDC/scUSD into Vertex lending pool (base lending yield ~10%).
‚Ä¢ Borrow $S or other tokens to trade perpetual futures on Vertex, leveraging funding rate arbitrage and additional rewards.
‚Ä¢ Monitor positions closely for profitable exits and regular collateral management.
‚Ä¢ Gain additional Sonic Points from active market participation.

Risks: Perpetual trading volatility, liquidation risk, fluctuations in funding rates.

The__Solstice,"Things that aren't priced into $TARA and why it will likely 100x+ here by 2026:

-All it's peers like $ICP, $SOL, $TRX, and $XLM are all billions of mcap. Taraxa is still 43 mil mcap because they chose building over associating with VC infested rats nests.

They've been building since 2018 and mainnet went live in 2023

-@fomodotbiz testnet is live and people will start launching soon. the market caps will be tiny at first (like 5-10k I believe or less), so many 10-100x's will be had, bringing fomo to the chain. 

-They just processed 61k transactions in ONE block. On MAINNET. This happened two days ago. The implications are more than your degenerate mind can grasp

-Taraxa is the only chain that can truly scale to trillions of mcap properly and mass process transactions. It has the lowest cost compute per performance. Since basically anyone can open a validator, it will be the most decentralized network. EVER.

-Vitalik spoke of ethereum becoming an EVM with tx costs of 0.0000005 some day. He literally described @taraxa_project, as $ETH went on to larp about L2's and cheesy rollups that could never possibly do what they intend to.

-It's all community like #SPX6900 
Remember when it sat there for a year just doing nothing until @MustStopMurad found it, then went 100x in a couple of weeks? 

I personally have been buying this for over a year and holding. There's no jeety kols to dump anything on anyone.

It's beginning to get attention from some bigger accounts like @XMaximist and @martypartymusic, but the party is truly just beginning.

-The flight for quality hasn't been processed yet. People spent all cycle gambling on memes and leverage, basically losing it all. There was very little value investing. No finding cool gems that could 100x that you could actually hold overnight. UNTIL NOW.

We're at ground 0. The festival is being set up. The rides are being placed. It's going to be a fun time.

No matter how hopeless crypto has felt for the aforementioned reasons all year, you are here because you believe in it. But somewhere along the path we lost our way.

CryptoTraalala,"Massive Liquidity Incoming to @Starknet!

What if 1% of Bitcoin's $1.6 trillion market cap moved to Starknet? We‚Äôre talking about $10+ billion entering Ethereum DeFi!

With cheaper transactions, faster speeds, and native Bitcoin  in DeFi, Starknet is unlocking possibilities Bitcoiners could barely imagined.

And top-tier dApps like @aave , @MorphoLabs, and @Uniswap  won‚Äôt be able to sleep on this. üëÄ

Bitcoin‚Äôs future in DeFi is here. Is your app ready?

1. @StarkWareLTD‚Äôs Vision

StarkWare‚Äôs vision is to scale bitcoin to serve everyone without financial barriers while enhancing privacy, decentralization and security.

But, it does not mean @Starknet is moving from Ethereum to Bitcoin.

Starknet will work on both chain Ethereum and Bitcoin !

2. What technical Improvements were done until now ?

üîπ STARK Proof on Bitcoin Testnet: StarkWare successfully verified a STARK proof on Bitcoin testnet, just as they do on Ethereum. This marks the first step toward scaling Bitcoin.

üîπ Optimizing Arithmetic Operations for STARKs: By optimizing how mathematical operations are performed, it makes STARK proof verification cheaper and less resource-intensive which reduces cost fees and increase the transaction speed

üîπ Verifier Efficiency Enhancement: Thanks to a new method Starkware makes the process of checking mathematical computations within STARK proofs faster and more resource-efficient. This is improving speed and reducing cost fees.

üîπ SHA256 Optimization for Bitcoin Script: With this optimization SHA256 hashing (a key part of Bitcoin's security) work faster and with fewer resources within Bitcoin's limited scripting environment.

‚Ä¢ 28% fewer operations ‚Üí Makes SHA256 computations faster, reducing execution time.

‚Ä¢ 26% less memory usage ‚Üí Optimizes resource consumption, allowing SHA256 to function more efficiently within Bitcoin‚Äôs limited scripting environment.

‚Üí This lower cost and resource usage.

üîπ Covenants Without Soft Forks: By implementing covenants without a soft fork, Bitcoin can gain more advanced features while avoiding the need for a controversial network upgrade. While the current implementation is slow and expensive, it demonstrates that these features can be added securely to Bitcoin's framework

üîπ L2 Bridge Between Starknet and Bitcoin: In collaboration with sCrypt, StarkWare introduced a proof-of-concept (PoC)  bridge on Bitcoin Signet to enable secure and decentralized interactions. This is a massive milestone toward a trustless L2 solution, promoting interoperability and for more use cases for both @Starknet and Bitcoin.

3. Lightning Network and Its Limitations

The Lightning Network is a Layer 2 scaling solution built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that aims to make transactions faster and cheaper. It enables instant, low-cost transactions by creating off-chain payment channels between users.

The Lightning Network was created to allows Bitcoin to be used for smaller, everyday transactions like buying a coffee or paying for a service, which would be impractical due to Bitcoin‚Äôs high transaction fees and slow processing times.

While Lightning improves Bitcoin for small payments, it has limitations:

üîπ Liquidity Issues: Users must lock up Bitcoins in channels, limiting capital efficiency.

üîπ Routing payments between users can fail if liquidity is insufficient.

üîπ It only supports simple transactions, not smart contracts or DeFi applications. So basically you send Bitcoin from Wallet A to Wallet B, and that‚Äôs all !

With Lightning Network only, Bitcoin cannot integrate broader economy features like DeFi.

But what if Bitcoin could scale beyond just payments ? What if bitcoin could enter the world of decentralized applications?

That‚Äôs where @Starknet comes in !

4. The Benefits of Starknet Scaling Bitcoin and Merging With Ethereum Ecosystem

Starknet is already revolutionizing Ethereum with ZK tech which is dramatically increasing transaction speed and reducing costs with a high level security.

If applied to Bitcoin, this could unlock entirely new possibilities:

1‚É£ For Users:

üîπ Cheaper Transactions with near-zero fees.

üîπ Almost instant Transactions: No need to wait for multiple Bitcoin block confirmations.

üîπ More Utility for Bitcoin with the unlock of DeFi (lending, borrowing, yield farming) without relying on centralized bridges.

2‚É£ For Developers:

As more liquidity will enter Starknet ecosystem, this could attract a lot of developers and a lot of innovation could see the day:

üîπ Bitcoin-native dApps and DAOs.

üîπ dApps that seamlessly integrate both Bitcoin and ETH liquidity.

üîπ Expand Bitcoin use like with AI agents, RWA, or tokenized Real Estate. The possibilities could become limitless ! All secured by Starknet.

3‚É£ For the Starknet Network:

üîπ Expanding the Starknet Ecosystem by bringing Bitcoin‚Äôs massive liquidity to Starknet

üîπ Starknet will become the layer where Bitcoin interacts with Ethereum‚Äôs DeFi stack.

üîπA trust-minimized way to use Bitcoin on Ethereum could attract more serious capital into Starknet.

üîπ More Liquidity, more dApp development bringing more users

4‚É£ For Bitcoin Network:

Bitcoin‚Äôs current throughput is widely unsufficient to become the world payment system !

Starknet, can scale bitcoin to 1 million transactions per second making Satoshi‚Äôs vision of Bitcoin as a world payment method a reality!

With lower fees and faster transactions, Starknet give access to Bitcoin, to the 1.5 billion unbanked individuals in the world to participate in the global economy.

Scaling bitcoin with Starknet will unlock new features such as:

üîπ Native Bitcoin on Starknet unlocks new DeFi utilities, allowing users to manage both Bitcoin and ETH in the same wallet for seamless interaction.

üîπ Atomic Bitcoin/ETH Swaps: This feature enables two parties to directly exchange Bitcoin for Ethereum without an intermediary like a centralized exchange, unlocking cross-chain liquidity between the two largest blockchain ecosystems.

üîπ Privacy, security and scalability

5. Market Potential

‚Ä¢ Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap: $1.6 trillion

‚Ä¢ Ethereum‚Äôs market cap: $250 billion

‚Ä¢ Total value locked in DeFi: $50 billion

‚Üí If just 1% of Bitcoin from the Bitcoin network were to enter the Starknet ecosystem, it could bring over $10 billion in potential capital to Ethereum-based DeFi.

This is a MASSIVE liquidity ! I don‚Äôt see how top-tier dApps like AAVE, Morpho, and Uniswap could overlook this opportunity, especially since they'll likely capture the largest share of the market.

Bitcoin holders who haven‚Äôt yet used DeFi will probably trust their funds with well-established and secure apps.

6. Why Bitcoin Maxis Should Care ?

‚Ä¢ Satoshi‚Äôs vision

Bitcoin‚Äôs current scalability limitations stand in the way of it becoming a global payment system as Satoshi wanted !

Starknet gives a scalable solution that aligns with Satoshi‚Äôs original vision, enabling Bitcoin to handle millions of transactions per second without compromising security.

No doubt that if Satoshi was still here, he would approve !

‚Ä¢ Bitcoin Relevance

Right now, Bitcoin utility is limited to a digital gold.

But Starknet makes it more relevant for the decades to come by ensuring Bitcoin can adapt to a growing decentralized economy.

‚Ä¢ Innovation with Integrity

Starknet can scale Bitcoin without compromising its decentralized principles.

Actually if OP_CAT was initially removed it was for security issue only. Starknet removes these security issues, making OP_CAT totally relevant to the current economy.

The integration provides tools for innovation, such as DeFi, private transactions, and self-custodial solutions, all built with respect for Bitcoin‚Äôs foundational values.

The future of crypto is not about competition but integration. Bitcoin remains the ultimate store of value, but it lacks flexibility.

In the other hand, Ethereum has the most advanced dApp ecosystem, but it needs more liquidity. Starknet can bridge this gap, allowing Bitcoin to scale without sacrificing security while connecting to Ethereum‚Äôs financial application: The best of both world !

Now, Imagine:

‚Ä¢ Bitcoin as a first-class DeFi asset

‚Ä¢ Trustless swaps between Bitcoin and ETH at near-zero cost with near instant transaction

‚Ä¢ Bitcoin-native dApps built with Cairo and deployed on Starknet

‚Ä¢ Institutional adoption of Bitcoin beyond just holding, it can be used productively

The economy system is set to evolve with time. Bitcoin and Ethereum together on Starknet is only a natural evolution. It has to happen !

Akshay001,"Thank you, dear Meeera & Sameer Jain, for having me / Leverage over at the @EconomicTimes Corporate Excellence Awards. Having only read about it since I was a school kid, felt quite the deal to attend it this very first time. And what spectacular show it was ‚ú® üßö 

Was great to meet some early Leverage believers, some old friends in the startup land, and some others who I‚Äôve wanted to meet for the longest time. To top it, the event had an incredible dose of inspiration, top to bottom, pure fuel! 

My top three moments:
- when N Chandrasekaran came to share some words about Bharat‚Äôs jewel, Sir Ratan Tata, he recalled the time when he‚Äôd made a request to renovate Bombay House, and Mr. Tata‚Äôs response, after a few moments, was ‚Äúwhere will the dogs go‚Äù ‚Ä¶. It pierced right through, something I deeply desire to achieve in life 
- one of our own, Peyush Bansal of Lenskart, also an early believer in Leverage, winning the Entrepreneur of Year award, and his wife‚Äôs note following that; its powering because it somehow signals that ‚Äúif we work hard enough, we will get there‚Äù
- Business Leader of the Year, Kumar Mangalam Birla Sir‚Äôs note, when he almost choked up .. I‚Äôve (by his good grace) had the chance to meet him a couple times in the last few years, but wouldn‚Äôt have ever reckoned him getting a tad emotional, and rightly so though, the impact ‚Äújust he has had‚Äù on the Birla Group, over last 30 years, that ability to survive and continue to win irrespective how many times they write you off, is so so powerful!

ET continues to be a beacon of business leadership in India. Glad that they are taking us into the future with focus on sustainability plus frontier technology, hand-in-hand :)

Thank you to all the awesome leaders I‚Äôve had a chance to engage with in the past in the ET ecosystem, @sruthijith @prachivermaET @sreeradhabasuET @RicaB_ET @Indulekha_A @IshaniDg @digbijaymishra1 @samidhas @brindasET @jessicarajan @GhaiNeil @pranavmukul","""1899052664945615280""","39262075"

NikkiSiapno,"SambaNova just launched the fastest DeepSeek-R1 671B.

It's 300% faster than the latest GPUs. How? RDUs.

RDUs (reconfigurable dataflow units) are purpose-built from the ground up for AI.

They're not retrofitted like GPUs which were originally built for graphics rendering.

The SN40L RDU that SambaNova released is the fastest and highest-efficiency processor currently available.

And this is great news for us developers. 

A single SN40L chip can hold hundreds of models (trillions of parameters) in memory!

The speed is a huge deal.

But the even bigger advantage is for agentic workflows running multiple specialized models.

GPUs can only process one model at a time, slowing down workflows that require multiple models to interact. SN40L removes that bottleneck, making multi-agent AI dramatically faster.

If you've been running the latest models, you know that inference speed has become a huge bottleneck.

And having to run smaller distilled versions is far from ideal.

With SambaNova's SN40L chip we can run versions like DeepSeek-R1 671B without slow response times. And we can run other models simultaneously.

‚Üí That means we can build and deploy fast agentic workflows

‚Üí It also means access to more powerful and faster coding assistants.

Whether you're deploying Llama, the latest DeepSeek models, or agentic workflows, SambaNova gives you a cloud-based playground to test, fine-tune, and deploy models at speed.

Create an account on SambaNova and use DeepSeek-R1 671B or Llama 3.1 405B here: https://t.co/a80lEZl2US

Manus, a New AI Agent From China is Going Viral‚ÄîAnd Raising Big Questions 
Manus is an autonomous agent that can analyze, plan, and execute tasks on its own. It is currently only accessible through invitation codes, which are in short supply - demand is through the roof as the AI community is raving about its capabilities. Many are now asking whether China has leapfrogged the US in AI. Manus likely achieved its impressive capabilities through innovative fine-tuning rather than core model innovation. A video introducing Manus is available in the article.

Apple Delays Siri Upgrade Indefinitely as AI Concerns Escalate 
Apple is delaying updates to Siri for the foreseeable future. The company's engineers believe that the features introduced last June won't be released until next year at the earliest. Several executives have voiced strong concerns as the features didn't work as advertised in their personal testing. Apple may have to rebuild the features from scratch.

üöÄScience & Futuristic Technology

Natural alternative to Ozempic brings results without side effects 
Stanford scientists have identified a naturally occurring molecule that works like semaglutide, producing weight loss and improved glucose and insulin tolerance, when tested in mice and minipigs. The peptide, named BRP, only works in the brain, as opposed to semaglutide, which has widespread effects. It specifically acts in the hypothalamus, which controls appetite and metabolism, which could be an improvement over semaglutide. The scientists intend to move to human clinical trials for BRP.

SpaceX's eight Starship test flight last Thursday aimed for the third successful booster recovery and the deployment of a satellite simulator. While the Super Heavy booster returned successfully to Starbase's launch tower, the mission's upper stage disintegrated during its flight. SpaceX has been reviewing the data from the flight to better understand the incident's root cause. Video of the explosion is available in the article.

Microsoft's Relationship With OpenAI Is Not Looking Good
More evidence has surfaced that Microsoft is looking to split with OpenAI. Microsoft is developing its own in-house reasoning models and has been testing models from xAI, Meta, and DeepSeek to replace ChatGPT in Copilot. Copilot has so far been received poorly in enterprise due to its high cost and limited results. OpenAI and Microsoft are quickly becoming competitors, so it makes sense that the companies would want to detach from each other. Microsoft has an interest in controlling the technologies and writing its own destiny.

Meta Takes Another Hit After Reports That It Blacklists Ex-Employees 
Meta reportedly maintains a de facto blacklist of ex-employees - even some former workers with sterling track records have been blocked. The company uses multiple systems to track rehire ineligibility, but the exact mechanisms and number of affected employees are unclear. While the blacklist may not sit well with outsiders, it is not illegal. The routine banishment of ex-workers isn't exclusive to Meta, with Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and many other companies purportedly maintaining similar lists.

BSCNews,"BINANCE GIVES USERS POWER TO VOTE ON TOKEN LISTINGS AND DELISTINGS

- Binance, the world's largest centralized exchange, is shifting its token listing strategy by introducing community co-governance.

- The move allows users to vote on which tokens should be listed or delisted, giving them a direct role in shaping Binance‚Äôs offerings.

Key Highlights:

- Users can vote for projects they want listed. Those with the most support and passing due diligence will be added.

- Users can also vote to remove tokens that lack development, have inactive teams, or pose risks.

- In recent months, Binance introduced new ways for projects to list, including Launchpool, Megadrop, and Pre-Market Trading.

- With Binance‚Äôs Alpha Observation Zone, early-stage projects get exposure before full listing approval.

Why It Matters:

- Crypto markets are flooded with new tokens, so exchanges are looking to refine their selection process.

- CoinMarketCap data shows crypto projects surged from 11 million to 12.4 million in weeks. A rapid influx of tokens raises concerns about quality and market fragmentation.

- Even Coinbase is rethinking its listing process, as CEO Brian Armstrong noted that 1 million tokens are created every week‚Äîmaking manual reviews unsustainable.

- This shift in governance could change how centralized exchanges manage token listings, giving users more power while maintaining quality control.

I think we've probably seen ETH/BTC rally/squeeze like 3-10% dozens of times the past year or so. The market selling off afterwards seems to be almost a certainty and its something everyone is aware of by now.

Tanaka_L2,"$LDO is good for the long term

I'm holding $LDO, and I'll share the challenges and risks that $LDO is facing, as well as whether it is suitable for long-term holding.

In my view, the biggest challenge Lido is facing is Ethereum‚Äôs decentralization requirement. In PoS chains, stakers play a crucial role in consensus formation.

Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem is strict about maintaining decentralization, especially since @LidoFinance  accounts for 8% of the total staked Ethereum. This has led to discussions about limiting Lido‚Äôs growth.

The Ethereum Foundation is also adjusting staking mechanisms to prevent the emergence of an overly dominant staking entity. Although Ethereum‚Äôs staking rate is still below 30% (28%), it remains significantly lower than other major PoS chains like $SOL (65%), $ADA (60%), and $SUI (77%).

However, the Ethereum team has repeatedly expressed concerns about excessive ETH staking and has proposed capping the staking ratio at a maximum of 30%. This limits Lido‚Äôs future growth potential.

Additionally, in the current market cycle, where ETH is underperforming, $LDO faces challenges due to its business model‚Äôs strong reliance on ETH‚Äôs price.

That said, as long as the current amount of staked ETH is maintained, Lido still generates a weekly gross profit ranging from $750,000 to $1.5 million.

With a more favorable regulatory environment and the protocol set to achieve ‚Äúprofitability‚Äù in accounting terms by 2024, the core team has begun discussing linking protocol revenue to $LDO in their 2025 plans.

If the US legalizes liquid staking, Lido could greatly benefit as institutional capital enters the staking market.

Therefore, we can expect that in 2025, $LDO will start receiving income from protocol staking. In conclusion, for these reasons, I still believe that $LDO is a strong long-term investment.

BSCNews,"BINANCE TERMINATES MARKET MAKER OVER IRREGULAR TRADING ON GPS & SHELL

- Binance officially delisted a market maker accused of unethical trading practices involving GoPlus Security $GPS and MyShell $SHELL tokens.

Here‚Äôs what we know:

The Issue:

- The market maker was found to have engaged in irregular trading, specifically manipulating the price of GPS by selling off large quantities of tokens right after their trading went live on Binance.

- The GPS price initially skyrocketed from $0.1304 to $0.2015, then plummeted to $0.08, reportedly causing massive losses for investors.

- Per reports, the market maker violated Binance‚Äôs rules by failing to maintain a fair order book, distorting buy and sell balance, neglecting liquidity requirements, and engaging in disruptive trading behavior.

Market Maker‚Äôs Impact on SHELL

- During the investigation into GPS, Binance uncovered that the same market maker was also handling liquidity for MyShell ($SHELL).

- While the exact misconduct with SHELL is unclear, given the previous violations with GPS, Binance is now reviewing activities with this project as well.

Binance‚Äôs Immediate Actions:

To protect the integrity of the market and users‚Äô interests, Binance took the following steps:

- Delisted the market maker from platform operations.
- Confiscated all illicit profits generated by the market maker.
- Announced plans to use seized profits for user compensation, with details to be shared by the respective projects, GoPlus and MyShell.

Project Teams Speak Out:

Both GoPlus Security and MyShell responded publicly to the incident:

- GoPlus Security ($GPS) Founder Mike acknowledged the mismanagement, apologized to the community, and promised to push for the repurchase of all sold GPS tokens by the market maker. He also clarified that the team itself has not sold any GPS tokens and that all team-held tokens can be tracked on-chain.

- MyShell ($SHELL) Co-founder Ethan Sun expressed regret over the situation and confirmed that the team terminated the market maker's services.

‚ÄúWe are aware of the ongoing MM situation and have taken immediate action by terminating our service with the involved market maker,‚Äù Sun noted. ‚ÄúIn the meantime, we are working closely with Binance to implement a solution as soon as possible. Further details on our plan will be shared soon.‚Äù

easonchaiii,"We recreated Polymarket on Scroll in under three weeks... all because we fucked up.

The real story? We started with a dream of building a lending protocol for Polymarket‚Äîan idea I was shocked no one had tackled before, given the data. The math was obvious: traders NEED to lock up massive capital in prediction markets and hold positions until market close. That capital sits there, unutilized. Inefficient. Wasteful. For months.

But when we entered Scroll Open, we hit our first wall: we'd need to build on Scroll. Impossible to directly interface with Polymarket. So what did we do? We pivot. Hard.

We started with an idea, a prediction market. But not just any market‚Äîwe wanted something new. A platform where financial participation drives real world outcomes. Think futarchy + prediction markets. We spent weeks on figuring out the system, ensuring there was no way to exploit it. It had the potential to deliver huge impact and it was something close to our hearts, it was transformative.

Then came the questions that every founder dreads: ""How will you get users?"" ""Targeting regen & social impact seriously limits your TAM."" ""You won't scale."" I wanted to ignore them. I tried to ignore them. But when the same feedback keeps hitting you from every direction, you have to listen.

So I looked at @Scroll_ZKP itself‚Äîobjectively, brutally. The chain had hemorrhaged from $1B TVL down to $80M. 24h DEX volume? A mere $1M with only 5,000 active wallets in the past day. These weren't just numbers. This was a reality check. We went back to users and asked what they actually wanted in a prediction market. The answer was clear: rewards and unlocked liquidity.

That's when everything clicked. We'd build Polymarket on Scroll, but with our original innovation intact: integrated lending and borrowing. The first of its kind. A prediction market where your positions don‚Äôt just sit there, they work for you.

With just two developers‚Äîthe same powerhouse builders who've brought countless products to life for our clients at @elvtd_io, we compressed what should have been months of work into mere weeks. We skipped building a CLOB because time was tight. But my team is beyond cracked. Huge shoutout to @cheekychain who created designs that are literally turning heads. We built. We tested. We iterated. We delivered.

And here's the most important thing I learned: We're not here just to win a hackathon. We're not building for 6 weeks. We're building for 6 months. For years. For the future. Because the true test of an entrepreneur isn't sticking stubbornly to your original vision‚Äîit's having the courage to adapt when reality demands it. It's about building something that will last. That will scale. That will actually work.

So yes, we pivoted from our heart project. But in finding what the market actually needed, we discovered something even more powerful: a path to sustainable impact.

Prediction markets with $30M daily volume + integrated lending? That's not just a hackathon project. That's a protocol with staying power.

Immensely proud of what we've accomplished. Wildly excited for what's next. This isn't the end. It's barely the beginning. Don‚Äôt fade @foresightnow.

hsinjuchuang,"Some personal news: 

I'm thrilled to announce that I've joined @hack_vc as a partner & head of platform. 8 yrs in crypto = a lifetime.

It all started in 2017 when a random recruiter slid into my DMs and told me about a job at @StellarOrg. I took a call with @JedMcCaleb (founder of Mt.Gox, Ripple, and Stellar) & Brit (co-founder of Lightyear). 

That was where I learned about (and fell in love with) crypto. I decided right then and there that I was going to enter the space whether they hired me or not. So üòÇ-- I offered Stellar a 1 month contract and told them they could pay me whatever they wanted, but that I was going to perform so well that they'd want to hire me at the end of the contract. 

Obviously, they accepted.
1 month later, they promoted me to head of growth & my crypto journey began. 

After I left Stellar, @edithyeung & @mccannatron introed me to @rajgokal @aeyakovenko from @solana. I met them very, very early when Solana was still at the whitepaper stage and had just gotten accepted into @500GlobalVC. I was with them as their head of growth till right before they launched their testnet. 

Then, after that, I did a short stint at Tezos (üòÖ), burned out, and decided to found my own startup @DystopiaLabs which was focused around building dev ecosystems + running events. I made a lot of good frens & threw a total of 17 ETH conferences around the world. 

Special thanks to @clairekart @Cameron_Dennis_ @ekang426 @Minittowinit @levychain @Sim_Pop @YalorMewn @VanessaGrellet_ @cryptomastery_ @StaniKulechov @LukeYoungblood @beechainstack @pet3rpan_ @marek_ @sui414 and so, so many more for supporting or speaking at our events over the yrs üôè‚ô•Ô∏è

Most recently, I was @FhenixIO which is an FHE infrastructure project created by @GuyItzh @GuyZys. I joined when the whitepaper was released & was with them till their second testnet. TLDR I'm very bullish on the future of the FHE category & knowing the team -- think they're very well positioned to succeed üöÄ. 

As for what‚Äôs next...
I'll be diving head first into venture capital üëÄ.

keoneHD,"It is easiest to raise capital when you don't need it.

This is true in a psychological sense [investors must be aggressive when you have the leverage] but there's a deeper reason too.

Your investors must believe that there is a decent chance they will make a ton of money by investing in your startup.

That requires having a clear path to a hugely successful business model. As in, you will get there no matter what, and accepting capital merely allows you to get there faster.

You want the debate in the IC to be about how fast you can grow, or what the challenges of scaling will be, or how durable the market is, or how hard it is for competitors to pivot and how big your lead is... not about whether there is a business there at all.

If your mentality is ""I need a million dollars to build my idea to prove to everyone that this business works"" then you are already in trouble. You need to get your startup to the point where you don't need money to prove that it works, it's just that more capital will help you scale up and accelerate.

üåçNavigating Global Compliance: Demands are rising, especially in the EU, where Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) are now mandatory for imports. Indian manufacturers must embrace traceability and data-driven reporting to succeed.

üå≥Transparency Beyond Greenwashing: Global buyers now require genuine sustainability, not just marketing claims. Full supply chain visibility, from sourcing to end-of-life, is essential, necessitating third-party audits and digital traceability.

üëîCircularity in Workwear: We explored how to create a closed-loop system for work clothing, emphasizing repair, recycling, take-back programs, and sustainable materials, aligning with Net Zero Carbon goals.

The key takeaway? Collaboration is crucial. Manufacturers, buyers, and technology innovators must work together to build a sustainable and transparent future for the textile industry. We‚Äôre committed to providing the blockchain-powered traceability solutions needed to meet these evolving demands.

thedefiedge,"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about who‚Äôs the best, it‚Äôs about who‚Äôs left‚Äù

A quick story about training mma and winning in Crypto long-term.

I‚Äôve been involved with various forms of combat sports for close to a decade. 4 years into it, I was ready to quit forever.

My injuries were starting to add up, my growth plateaued, and an 18 year old hotshot was beating me (and my ego) after only a few months of training.

I realized that talent was real, and that I wasn‚Äôt talented in this area. Hmm...maybe Yoga would be better for me, and I could meet some babes.

At the end of class, my coach said something to that class that I'd never forget.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about who‚Äôs the best, it‚Äôs about who‚Äôs left‚Äù

What did he mean by this?

There‚Äôs always going to be people who are more talented than you. But talent comes and goes. What‚Äôs even rarer than talent is the guy who just keeps showing up. The person who‚Äôs consistent. 

The guy who eventually becomes the best is the one who keeps training.

This meant prioritizing recovery. This means putting down your EGO and not going 100% against the new kid and risking injury. This means investing in a strength & conditioning protocol so you can keep training long-term.

Right now I‚Äôm visiting my parents and stopped by my old mma gym. My coach is still there. The place still looks the same, although the gloves needs to be replaced. 

There‚Äôs a new generation of people I‚Äôve never seen before. I‚Äôm not as fast or as strong as I used to be. But I kept training the past decade, and let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm no longer the weakest at the gym.

Everyone from my generation is gone. Most of the people I thought were super talented quit a long time ago, or never fully recovered from injuries.

This story makes me think a lot about Crypto and survival.

If you just keep showing up, you‚Äôll get better. But that means you have to prioritize survival.

In the gym that meant not over-training, not letting my ego get the best of me, and training in a way that was sustainable in the long-term. Developing a game that would age well instead of fancy, athletic based movements.

What does this look like in Crypto?

‚Ä¢ Taking profits even though you‚Äôre bullish

‚Ä¢ Increasing your long-term BTC stash

‚Ä¢ Avoiding leverage and other ways that can ‚Äúinjure you‚Äù

‚Ä¢ Only playing when you have an advantage

‚Ä¢ Instead of burning out, figuring out a way to be in Crypto that's more sustainable. Researching 3 hours a day everyday vs 14 hrs a day and burning out every few weeks. 

‚Ä¢ Being comfortable leaving money on the table. I‚Äôm going shopping this week for some tokens. I‚Äôm ok with not getting the perfect entry - I just want to make sure I have exposure.

There‚Äôs a glorification of the guys who made it in one cycle. 

Extreme survivorship bias - you'll hear about that guy but not the thousands of people who went busto trying to do the same thing.

You‚Äôll make it if you‚Äôre one of the last guys standing.","""1898929740062589008""","1480297433020215297"

The reality is that very few people have the ability to make the crazy trades *and* sell at a good time

It takes a different set of skills and sensibilities to take the high risk route and have a portfolio do several multiples vs take the ‚Äúsensible‚Äù and cautious route of profit taking and sticking to the safer coins (and stables)

And on top of it all, social media has a way of warping your perspective on everything

andrewchen,"random thoughts/predictions on where vibe coding might go:

- most code will be written (generated?) by the time rich. Thus, most code will be written by kids/students rather than software engineers. This is the same trend as video, photos, and other social media

- we are in the command line interface days of vibe coding. For the majority of creators, vibe coding will eventually fade, and vibe designing (with a visual paradigm) will come to dominate. People ultimately think better in a GUI-like format than a CLI-like format. Thus, in vibe designing you will show the AI the design outcomes you want, and then everything else is done for you. Yes, you may end up with tools to tweak the design details for extra controllability, and provide additional mockups that then get filled in underneath with code. But maybe folks will build software without seeing or learning a programming language.

- vibe coding could reduce the need for open source libraries as more code will be generated from scratch by AI. Code will be more of a disposable commodity, with less reuse, and instead generated on the fly for personalized use. It's interesting to see right now that creating a new project is easier than editing a project, because the latter requires a lot more context/complexity. Interesting dynamics if something like this continues

- ""trad UX"" and design standards give way to post-modern/fragmented software, as millions of new vibe coders create experiences with no prior know how and new perspectives. New patterns will emerge, as TikTok/YouTube has done to film making and trad entertainment. The world will go beyond buttons and modals and scrollbars and other things. Software may become unrecognizable before it coalesces again

- if vibe coding makes software trivial to build, then the bottlenecks shift to other places: 1) consistent creativity that stays ahead of everyone else. Anyone can write a tweet, but the best creators are the ones who consistently come up with new ideas. 2) distribution and network effects, where the first vibe coded product doesn't win, but rather the first vibe coded product that hits scale that wins

- imagine products that automatically adapt based on user behavior, rather than based on the actions of the vibe coder. For example, if the vibe coder has specified that the signup funnel should easy, then after seeing users struggle with it, the software can automatically vibe code itself to improve the flow by dropping steps or adding explanatory text. Right now we are in a paradigm where PMs specify behavior that software engineers specify in code. Imagine if PMs can specify outcomes, and the software is configured to automatically adapt to hit those outcomes

what other wacky ideas should be on this list?","""1898874271663087622""","3283901"

Pavel Popescu, Vice President of Romania‚Äôs National Authority for Communications (ANCOM), announced that the government will suspend TikTok until state institutions complete their investigation into the first round of presidential elections.

With mass protests erupting over the Deep State‚Äôs ban on elected President CƒÉlin Georgescu, many question whether this move is about security or silencing dissent.

Is the government trying to control the flow of information?

This is the news that everyone was expecting, and honestly, it feels like the universe just took a deep breath and said, ""Alright, let‚Äôs get this show on the road!""

 For weeks, months, even we‚Äôve been sitting on the edge of our seats, speculating, debating, and refreshing our feeds like it‚Äôs some kind of Olympic sport. 

The anticipation was thick enough to scoop with a ladle (because who uses anything sharper for that?).

 And now, here we are, staring down the barrel of the Big Reveal. It‚Äôs like Christmas, your birthday, and that time you found 1 Doge on an old drive all rolled into one glorious package.

Let‚Äôs be real for a second this didn‚Äôt just happen overnight.

 There were whispers in the wind, cryptic hints dropped like breadcrumbs, and enough rumors to fill a conspiracy theorist‚Äôs dream journal. 

Some of us called it ages ago, while others were too busy arguing about whether the moon is made of cheese or just really good CGI. 

But now the cat‚Äôs out of the bag, the cards are on the table, and we can all collectively exhale. It‚Äôs not just news; it‚Äôs the news. 

The kind that makes you text your friends in all caps and overuse exclamation points like they‚Äôre going out of style!!!

What‚Äôs wild is how this whole thing unfolded. 

It‚Äôs like watching a slow-motion train wreck you can‚Äôt look away from except instead of a wreck, it‚Äôs a train pulling into the station right on schedule, unloading a cargo of pure, unfiltered ‚ÄúI told you so.‚Äù 

The doubters are quiet now, the skeptics are eating their hats, and the believers? 

Oh, we‚Äôre just over here doing a victory lap around the internet.

 This isn‚Äôt just a win for the optimists; it‚Äôs a win for anyone who dared to dream that something big was coming. And boy, did it deliver.

So where do we go from here? 

The world keeps spinning, the feeds keep scrolling, and life marches on. 

But this this feels like a turning point.

 A moment to pause, reflect, and maybe even crack open a celebratory beverage of your choice. 

We‚Äôve got a lot to unpack, a lot to discuss, and probably a few memes to make along the way.

 Because if there‚Äôs one thing we‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs that good news deserves to be shouted from the rooftops, or at least blasted across every group chat you‚Äôre in.
In the end, though, it‚Äôs not just about the hype or the headlines. It‚Äôs about what we do with it. 

How we take this energy and turn it into something real, something lasting. 

And that‚Äôs where the ethos comes in the idea that no matter what‚Äôs happening out there, we should always try to Do Only Good Everyday. 

That‚Äôs the spirit of Doge Coin, isn‚Äôt it? 

A little bit of fun, a little bit of rebellion, and a whole lot of heart.

 So let‚Äôs keep that vibe alive, keep pushing forward, and keep doing good, one day at a time.","""1898854620996223194""","1405156811796357120"

wassielawyer,"Unsolicited late night thoughts on how to fix the crypto venture financing / altcoin space.

1. Make '% of Company Reserve' meta again. 

In 2022, it was a lot more common to see private investors invest into projects and receive a % of Company Reserve v.s. % of FDV. This means when I invest 1m at 100m, I don't get 1% of total FDV. I get 1% of whatever the team supply is (so if its 20%, I get 0.2%). 

This creates a situation where investor and team are more aligned and far less tokens are being emitted.

This has fallen off a lot more recently although I still rarely see them with good projects and strong founders.

Sure, this means you will raise less money at lower vals which leads me to my next point.

2. Raise less, at lower valuations

Lets get real here. 90% of projects don't need 10m+ dollars pre-PMF to build a dApp or a chain. We all know half of you fork code and/or outsource most of your shit to Eastern Europe / SEA / LatAm anyway.

Raising at lower vals means you don't get pressure to launch at retarded vals where the only buyer is the MM you pay (using the 5m dollars you have left after exorbitant salaries and parties). 

3. Make the fair launch actually fair

If you are going to do a 'fair launch' make it actually fair. That means allowing everyone to participate on clearly defined parameters that are not based on who you know or how early you are.

Fair launch + getting an MM to snipe your own launch is retarded. Echo rounds where access is gated is retarded. Nobody wants to be someone else's exit liquidity because he knew a guy or got in early. 

4. Time based unlock for team makes zero sense

Why is the team's economics tied to an arbitrary period of time? Shouldn't it be correlated to... actually making the product work?

This disincentivizes all the market-making nonsense where a team basically just tries to manage token price until the unlocks happen.

5. The token is not the product

Founders need to build something actually useful that people want to use instead of simply paying KOLs to shill the token, TVL providers / liquid funds to counterfeit retail activity and market makers to play the same ponzi game that everyone is playing.

 6. Exchanges should moderate

I'm surprised that exchanges have generally participated in a race to the bottom by competing for listings rather than actually creating strict listing rules and sanctioning projects that do not abide.

Actually I'm not surprised because they get fat listing fees + the ponzi projects have the most volume thanks to a literal army of market makers.

whatslukedoing,"What's good about @pixels_online is regardless of market conditions we can still build and test our tech.  

The core of what we're working on is solving p2e at scale - clown me all you want - we're not there yet, but each month we're getting closer.  

We have been giving out rewards to users at scale and building out models & prediction on what happens when you give a reward to a certain segment / cohort of users. 
What we want to know are things like, if you are able to use rewards to increase revenue, to increase ARPPU, to decrease initial time to first monetization, to boost retention of certain cohorts? Can you start to build predict what users early on in the journey will convert?  

This tech works without crypto too. If you build these models you can them with fiat, stables, or any currency. 

How I kind of view p2e is basically through this framing: If you were able to boost certain metrics in your web2 game like retention, LTV, or k-factor by 20-30% how much more successful would it be? That's where p2e can be applied. 

Pixels has been able to increase it's reward efficiency from 28% to ~70% in the last 6 months - and to be honest the biggest thing in our way has been our core game. The core game is improving month-by-month, but what's interesting is we can also accelerate our progress by working with other games too.

We're already opening our tech & current models to other teams. What's interesting is that the ecosystem may have an even better chance to reach our goal of net revenue when working with other games even quicker.   

This tech that we're building will be able to generate other revenue streams outside of our main token - there are already other teams we're talking to that have willingness to pay.

Web3 offers other very interesting ways to tokenize this business model.  At the end of the day, we're building our own first-party games (new ones like our pets app on the way) - but the bigger picture is we're also building a new type of ad network.

What we're building is kind of like an ad network where we reward users to participate in good / positive ecosystem behavior.  

Regardless of how you feel about core pixels & state of the game - (believe me we love Core Pixels and are dedicated to making it as good as we possibly can) - there is also something bigger here that we're building - this tech is important, has real value, and people are willing to pay for it.

Teams that build things of real value are not going anywhere in the long-run. Clown us in the short-term if you want but teams that are persistent in building real things will win.

You don't have to believe in what we're doing - but I do & will keep building ü´°","""1898822019548102789""","996044832"

llamaonthebrink,"The reason ppl have this extractive view of the chain is because the ecosystem has hardly produced anything new, has created little open source value, and has played deceptive narrative games for years.

The fact that ‚ÄúMEV‚Äù infra is the most funded thing on that chain right now is literal evidence of that.

In 2023, Ethereum was criticized by podcasters because there was too much focus on MEV and scaling infra by VCs.

In 2021, the solana narrative was that It didn‚Äôt have evil extractive MEV like ethereum does, that blocks were produced so fast that the demand for ordering preference just magically evaporates. 

This was literally touted by sol leadership and others in crypto media.

Today, the entire value prop and narrative for solana is that you stake SOL to earn MEV. 

They went from saying MEV is evil and doesn‚Äôt exist on solana to building the entire ecosystem on top of it. They even try to rally behind a new (rather unoriginal) name for MEV as if it erases this history.

In 2020 Ethereum created a ton of net new use cases and open source protocols that are the basis and foundation of all onchain applications that exist today, on all chains, regardless of the VM being used.

There was a wealth effect that had legitimacy to it. Something legitimately new was being experimented with in real time.

But for the past year, nearly all the activity on Solana has been purely extractive, with little produced value for the industry. 

For those who don‚Äôt know, MEV literally stands for Maximal Extractable Value. And this is now the basis of the sol ecosystem. Something which wasn‚Äôt supposed to exist.

Solana raised in the depths of a bear where its ""competitors"" raised at way crazier multiples ‚Äî it barely launched before completely running out of money in a way different environment, where nothing had scaled crypto before

> then it was the chain for celebs and KOLs to do pump and dumps on retail.

Study where NFTs and ICOs came from 

once again, every single chain with activity has this since scaling crypto inherently involves scaling the good and (unfortunately) the bad

total nonsense to say ""no one talks about it"", it's roughly a third of all discourse

pzakin,"Nearly 2 years into my transition to being an investor, a few notes:

- My 1 liner of what I look for: exceptional founders building something radical (that people want). Radical companies feel a bit strange; what feels normal is usually territory for incumbents.

- The epitaph for my career as a founder is that I cared more about ideas than customers. It's hard for me to get excited by founders who seem likely to make my mistakes. It's not a movie I like to rewatch.

- The companies I've gotten most excited about are not companies that reaffirm my theses (I'm pretty self-conscious about confirmation bias) but the ones that manage to change my mind. 

- I think we under-appreciate how exceptional the best founders are. I think a lot about Brian Scalibrine: ""I'm way closer to Lebron than you are to me"". 

-  Talent vs. access. If you don't have Sequoia's access, you better hope you can mine talent in places they're not looking. As talent becomes more legible (Thiel fellowship, Prod, YC) it becomes harder to compete against firms that have better access.","""1898792278594121881""","23171244"

@PressSec:

‚ÄúI can confirm there is no feud [between President Trump, Elon Musk and Secretary of State Marco Rubio].¬†

Everybody is on board with President Trump's mission and DOGE's mission to identify this waste and fraud‚Äîto be good stewards of the American taxpayers' money.¬†

Both Elon and Marco are doing an incredible job in their respective roles.¬†

And that's true of everybody in President Trump's cabinet.

He has really put together an extraordinary team.¬†

I think it's pitiful that the mainstream media is working overtime to try to divide President Trump from Elon and from other members of his Cabinet.¬†

The Democratic Republic of Congo is one of the world‚Äôs most dangerous places, especially for women and Christians.

Last month, ISIS-linked ADF terrorists beheaded 70 Christians in a church as they push to control eastern Congo. 

Sexual violence is rampant, with 895 rapes reported in two weeks of February. In October, M23 rebels overran Goma, leading to the mass rape of 150 female prisoners‚Äîmany were then burned alive. 

Armed groups now raid hospitals, kidnap patients, and force hundreds of thousands to flee.

M23 rebels control most of Goma, displacing civilians as they battle government forces. 

Meanwhile, a mystery disease in northwestern Congo has killed 60 people within a day. Tests for Ebola and Marburg were negative, leaving doctors without answers. 

At the same time, children as young as four mine cobalt, a key mineral for batteries. Despite global outcry, China controls 80% of these mines, profiting from forced labor.

Congo‚Äôs crisis is more than minerals. 

Terrorism, ethnic conflict, and corruption have made it a warzone. 

As armed groups and foreign powers exploit the chaos, some argue the U.S. and world leaders must act before it worsens.

chameleon_jeff,"Hyperliquid = HyperCore + HyperEVM.

One piece of user feedback since HyperEVM‚Äôs alpha launch was to more intuitively communicate how the HyperEVM fits into the larger context of Hyperliquid. To this effect, the native pieces of the Hyperliquid execution state have been organized under one umbrella term: HyperCore.

HyperCore consists of performant native components: order book perp and spot DEX, staking, oracles, multi-sig, etc. HyperEVM is a general purpose world-computer, allowing builders to deploy code that interacts with both HyperEVM and HyperCore. Together, they form one global, composable state on Hyperliquid, secured by the state-of-the-art HyperBFT consensus algorithm. Importantly, any interaction across the Core/EVM boundary is part of execution itself. There is one unified state, with no need for bridging, proofs, or trusted signers.

HyperEVM offers builders a familiar interface to plug into the most powerful permissionless financial system in crypto. Let's walk through some concrete examples.

A project XYZ deploys an ERC20 contract on the HyperEVM using standard EVM tooling. They deploy a corresponding spot asset XYZ permissionlessly in the HyperCore ticker auction. Once the XYZ HyperCore token and HyperEVM contract are linked, users can seamlessly transfer their XYZ balance to HyperCore for order book trading. Two key improvements compared to CEX listings:

1) The entire process is permissionless. No behind-the-scenes negotiations for preferential treatment. Hyperliquid is a neutral platform for finance.
2) There is no bridging risk between HyperCore and HyperEVM. On the other hand, CEXs need to manage deposits and withdrawals through wallets that could be hacked. HyperCore and HyperEVM are one unified state.
Trading and building on the same chain is a 10x product improvement over CEXs.

Let's go further. A lending protocol sets up a pool contract that accepts XYZ as collateral and lends out another token ABC to the borrower. To determine the liquidation threshold, the lending smart contract can read XYZ/ABC prices directly from the HyperCore order books using a ""read precompile."" For a Solidity developer, this is as simple as calling a built-in function.

Suppose the borrower's position requires liquidation. The lending smart contract can send orders directly swapping XYZ and ABC on the HyperCore order books using a ""write precompile."" Again, this is a simple built-in function in Solidity. In a few lines of code, the lending protocol has implemented protocolized liquidations similar to how perps function on HyperCore. A theme of the HyperEVM is to abstract away the deep liquidity on HyperCore as a building block for arbitrary user applications.

As these interactions become available on mainnet HyperEVM, I look forward to seeing the innovative ways that builders leverage these primitives to reinvent finance. These examples only scratch the surface of what is possible.

The USA is launching a strategic Bitcoin Reserve

Microsoft is cutting ties from OpenAI despite $Bs of investment.

Stock market loses *trillions* of dollars in the biggest down-day this year

Some thoughts:

China is beating the USA in AI 

This week we got 2 new ground-breaking AI products from China:

Manus - basically the AI Agent love child of DeepResearch, OpenAI‚Äôs agent operator & Claude‚Äôs computer use.

&

QWEN-32B - Alibaba‚Äôs new AI model that rivals DeepSeek but at 5% the cost.

For context:

QWEN is fully open source, meaning anyone can leverage it as a Public good.

Oh & it‚Äôs small enough to run on your MacBook

Which means it can use all your personal data, files, apps securely & privately to give you the ultimate personal agent experience.

Meanwhile we‚Äôre yet to see similar retaliation from US-based AI, 

Especially in open source.

The gap between nations is closing.

Agent frameworks are levelling up

This week @arcdotfun & @elizaOS announced some exciting updates

ElizaOS‚Äôs token will soon have value-accrual via their token launch pad, multi-agent products & reputation-based trading platform.

Arc is launching a universal App Store for agents on top of ARC, where purchases for services will feed back to its token $ARC.

This step from both teams towards generating revenue back to their native tokens is crucial for long term success.

Success imo will depend on how well curated the apps / agents are within both ecosystems.

Agent protocols is now a BD Game.

Following on from my point above, it‚Äôs become increasingly clear that we need high quality agents.

IMO that‚Äôll come down to the effectiveness of teams like Virtuals, arc, elizaOS & others to find, fund & curate the best teams to build on their stack.

Alternatively, I think there‚Äôs an opportunity for non framework-aligned builders to build something custom and novel eg AIXBT.

Al Agent sector hit the hardest

No sugar-coating it, it‚Äôs brutal out there.

We‚Äôve now seen 70-90% drawdowns across most AI coins.

Whilst this is likely a knock-on effect of wider macro shifts (tariffs, recession)

it can‚Äôt go ignored that AI is hit the hardest.

While brutal, it makes sense given how far out on the risk-curve this sector is.

It‚Äôs new, still finding its feet - therefore experiences the most volatility.

Silver-lining however is all the amazing work, progress & commitment I‚Äôm seeing from top teams across the stack.

From resources (eg prime intellect, Nous)

To coordination networks (eg bittensor)

To application / services (eg agent protocols)

I know I sound like a broken record at this point but I maintain the belief that there‚Äôs so much potential in the crypto AI space 

& now‚Äôs the best time as any to be heads down figuring this shit out

Physics is fundamentally just understanding how the universe actually works. 

That's a good foundation for a variety of engineering disciplines. 

The analytical constructs used in physics [like first-principles thinking] apply to basically anything. 

Most people tend to think by analogy or by comparison with something that already exists.

Ye: Okay so what were you telling me about? 

Ansem: So blockchains are essentially like global app stores where anybody can permissionlessly create their own applications and essentially get access to a ton of liquidity globally from people all over the world. 

Take Apple. You can get approval to get in the app store and then Apple takes a cut off all the revenue of your app.

With something like Solana, if you build an app on Solana, there's nobody who will take a cut. 

You can build whatever you want to build and immediately access everyone who has a crypto wallet. 

And anybody can make a crypto wallet at any point in time.

And then the second thing I was saying as far as connecting your community to crypto... 

You said what do you want your legacy to be, what do you want your biggest focus to be. And you said you want to build community.

FIP_Crypto,"Minting Soneium Ecosystem Badges is chaotic.
‚Äã
There's no unified dashboard or clear way to track if you're eligible before the snapshot.
‚Äã
So here's a full breakdown of every task I'm doing before 31 March to qualify for most badges (along with my task tracker):                                                                                                                                    
 
_______________________________________
‚Äã
The badges
‚Äã
There are 20+ projects issuing Ecosystem Badges on Soneium, and here are the details:
‚Äã
‚ùç Snapshot period: March 7-31
‚ùç Badge claiming: Apr 15
‚Äã
While some projects like @sakefinance plan to release eligibility checkers in the future:
‚Äã
There's still no way to track your progress, or even know what tasks are required.
‚Äã
So I compiled all of the ones I'm doing (and skipping) so far:
‚Äã
_______________________________________
‚Äã
DEXes and perps
‚Äã
Most of these are the standard actions and they can be paired with actions for other projects.
‚Äã
1. Kyo
‚Äã
Task: Complete ‚â• 10 transactions, with ‚â• 1 LP transaction (min. volume of $100)
‚Äã
https://t.co/WbFg8qo9eY
‚Äã
Kyo has some stable pools (ASTR/nASTR, WBTC/solvBTC):

So I added liquidity there without incurring significant impermanent losses.
‚Äã
_
‚Äã
2. Quickswap
‚Äã
Task: Perform ‚â• 10 swap or LP transactions
‚Äã
https://t.co/crTGhR6Ig5
‚Äã
My plan is to LPs here with the tokens I swapped on other DEXes.
_
‚Äã
3. SoneFi
‚Äã
Tasks:
‚ùç ‚â• 10 swaps 
‚ùç ‚â• 10 perp transactions
‚Äã
https://t.co/R5rRZ1UmHm
‚Äã
Trading on the DEX is straightforward, and here‚Äôs what I did for perps:
‚Äã
The minimum order is 10 USD, so I used 1.1x leverage for each trade to incur minimal losses.
‚Äã
With each $10 trade, these are the fees I pay per transaction:
‚Äã
‚ùç $0.02 (in ETH) per action (e.g. opening a TP/SL)
‚ùç $0.01 in trading fees
‚Äã
Volume doesn‚Äôt matter so I‚Äôm not paying a significant amount per trade to complete all 10 trades.
‚Äã
_
‚Äã
4. SoneX
‚Äã
Task: 80 swap transactions + ‚â• 320 USDT worth of staked LP
‚Äã
https://t.co/lQGnH7gWEo
‚Äã
The highest requirement of all the badges, so it's not worth interacting if you don't have the time.
‚Äã
SoneX only counts LPs under the 'Farm' tab, and I chose to deposit into ASTR/nsASTR since it gives 1,273% in APR for a stable pool.
‚Äã
Though they're the only protocol with a dashboard to check your progress:
‚Äã
https://t.co/7XCFmp5PIz
_
‚Äã
5. Sonus
‚Äã
Tasks: 
‚ùç Lock SONUS for veSONUS ‚â• 5 times (min. 100 SONUS)
‚ùç Swap on Sonus ‚â• 10 times
‚Äã
https://t.co/GCTzzhKqM3
‚Äã
There's no requirement on the lock duration, so I just set it at 1 week for each lock.
_
‚Äã
6. SuperVol
‚Äã
Task: ‚â• 10 trades (excluding coupon trades)
‚Äã
https://t.co/qCEuN7JP5y
‚Äã
I'm a horrible trader, so this options game is super risky for me.
‚Äã
Each round lasts for an hour (4 assets are available), giving us a chance to win $100 based on the how much we put in.

I'm going for the $95-$99 trades as they have the highest chance of being correct (since the risk is low).
‚Äã
If the prediction goes wrong, I lose everything.

(So that's something to consider)
‚Äã
But once the price for that option reaches $100, we won't be able to purchase it.
‚Äã
I usually wait till the last 10 minutes to make a decision and see what trades are available then.
‚Äã
Feel free to use my referral link: https://t.co/cgBCtJwDxn
‚Äã
I've made a few trades and will share my strategies for this soon.
_
‚Äã
7. WaveX
‚Äã
Task: Complete ‚â• 10 on-chain transactions on WaveX (Earn + Trade)
‚Äã
https://t.co/q4uh0ehm0O
‚Äã
I'm not a trader, so I deposited ASTR into the 'Earn' feature to buy WaveX's WLP (similar to the Hyperliquid HLP).
‚Äã
There's no 'minimum amount' requirement, so I bought small amounts each time for the WLP.
‚Äã
_______________________________________
‚Äã
Lending
‚Äã
8. Sake
‚Äã
Task: Deposit and borrow the listed assets (ASTR, USDC, USDT, ETH, SONE) on 2 pools: Main and ASTR.
‚Äã
https://t.co/mIpSEd8jDF

This is straightforward and it's a great way to force myself to push some swap transactions on other DEXes (to get these assets).
‚Äã
I'm not sure if it's cumulative (i.e. I qualify when depositing 10 ASTR x 10 times), but the borrow amounts are low.
‚Äã
_
‚Äã
9. Untitled Bank
‚Äã
Task: Complete ‚â• 10 transactions on the platform
‚Äã
https://t.co/IJ8d7xxAAC
‚Äã
A straightforward one, we can deposit in 'Earn' or 'Borrow' features to complete this task.

‚Äã
I missed the first NFT, so I don't think I'll qualify for it unless I purchase it on the marketplace.
‚Äã
I'll monitor this but as of now, I don't intend to purchase the NFT yet (unless I managed to mint the second NFT).

‚Äã
12. FractalVisions (skipped)

https://t.co/7r0EC0YyAi
‚Äã
The are a few ways to complete transactions here:
‚Äã
‚ùç Mint ‚â• 3 Hand Cards
‚ùç Claim EXP after the timer ends
‚ùç Upgrade your Hand Card to Level 2
‚Äã
Not much info yet because the New Epoch is launching in a day, so I'll look at it again if I manage to mint it.

_
‚Äã
14. Posse Studios
‚Äã
Task: Complete ‚â• 11 transactions
‚Äã
https://t.co/RYqg0PaYds
‚Äã
The cheapest NFTs (based on floor price) cost ~ $0.50 in ASTR, but it costs $0.01 to create an NFT.
‚Äã
I plan to create multiple NFTs, spaced out across different days.
‚Äã
_
‚Äã
15. Sonova (skip?)
‚Äã
Task: Trading NFTs and holding Sonova ACS NFTs
‚Äã
https://t.co/UkwCHZmCTh
‚Äã
The criteria are very vague here, so I'm not sure how I can qualify for this badge.
‚Äã
I bought a Sonova ACS edition NFT for 0.00016 ETH ($0.34) but I believe that trading volume could play a role here.
‚Äã
_
‚Äã
16. Unemeta
‚Äã
Task: ‚â• 30 interactions
‚Äã
https://t.co/2pZ3D1NAmK
‚Äã
There are 2 main interactions to complete:
‚Äã
‚ùç Daily check-in
‚ùç Daily draw (costs 2 ASTR or $0.07)
‚Äã
If we perform these in 15 days, we'll qualify for the badge.

‚ùç Hold a 2P2E Pioneer NFT (TBC)
‚Äã
https://t.co/YBvUhZWVkk
‚Äã
This is pure gambling, so I'm skipping it for now.
‚Äã
The minimum trade is 0.001 ETH, so 'maybe' I'll do it if I make some profits from SuperVol.

18. SynStation
‚Äã
Task: ‚â• 30 transactions

‚Äã
There's no minimum trade amount, so I plan to make 30 predictions ($0.20 each).

Games
‚Äã
19. Arcas
‚Äã
Task: Perform ‚â• 10 transactions, which include:
‚Äã
‚ùç Buy/Sell $50 worth of ARCAS on Kyo
‚Äã
‚ùç Buy or Sell a Bastonium NFT (Floor price of 0.0098 ETH)
https://t.co/xTsSrE6QKO
‚Äã
‚ùç Stake/Update an @ArcasChampions Prime Program NFT (TBC)

‚Äã
A nice 2-in-1 with Kyo where I can buy/sell and complete the $100 volume requirement by trading ARCAS.

But I incur quite a bit of slippage with these swaps.

I'm skipping the other 2 actions, especially for the NFT (since the mint price is high).

I think whatever move comes from here will be decisive for the following couple of weeks of trending price action.

Above ~$90K and holding there, and I think we re-visit the all time high. This would be in line with previous consolidations, range breakdowns & retakes.

Below ~$80K and holding there (can be a wick as we saw before) would show a lot of weakness. In that case I think we can start looking for the previous range high test at the ~$74K region. This isn't my main scenario but it's something to keep in mind.

MarioNawfal,"üá∫üá¶ üá®üá© U.S / UKRAINE MINERAL DEAL: A PLAYBOOK FOR CONGO AND BEYOND?

It‚Äôs something China has been doing for decades‚Äîmeddling in other countries through economic investments that let them own ports, mines, farmland, and more.

With a potential U.S.-Ukraine partnership, America is creating a similar model‚Äîbut with the semblance of security guarantees in exchange for these crucial and strategic resources. 

And now, Congo wants in‚Äîa deal that could end one of Africa‚Äôs deadliest conflicts while securing America‚Äôs access to critical minerals.

Both Congo‚Äôs Felix Tshisekedi and Rwanda‚Äôs Paul Kagame are pushing for a U.S. security deal that would stabilize the region while ensuring Washington gets direct access to cobalt, lithium, and other essential minerals‚Äîa win-win for African stability and U.S. industry.

If this model works, it could become the new U.S. foreign policy playbook: providing military and economic support to resource-rich nations without costly wars or political entanglements‚Äîjust stability in exchange for economic security.

But here‚Äôs the problem:  Trump has stopped short of offering security guarantees explicitly for the mineral deal with Ukraine - but in reality, as Rubio has said, where U.S ‚Äúinterests‚Äù are, they will ‚Äúprotect‚Äù those interests.

Is this the future of U.S. global strategy?

people chase roles, levels, and positions thinking it gives them leverage, but that‚Äôs constant leverage: predictable, fixed floors of power, status, and expectations. comfortable‚Äîbut fragile, since someone always wants your spot.

i‚Äôve found something better: variable leverage. no title, no level, no fixed expectations‚Äîjust pure agency. move fast, execute freely, hit goals. no oversight needed when you‚Äôre clear on outcomes. this setup feels chaotic to others, but it‚Äôs where i thrive best.

ironically, variable leverage often beats constant leverage at its own game. u don‚Äôt need formal power to make big things happen‚Äîjust clarity, speed, autonomy and trust.

compensation? still proportional to performance‚Äîtitles don‚Äôt always dictate your worth.

and the best part about variable leverage: you can apply it anywhere. you‚Äôre never trapped.

Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) is pushing to bring its Arrow missile defense system to the United States, following Trump‚Äôs executive order to build a national missile defense shield.

 IAI CEO Boaz Levy:

‚ÄúWe believe President Trump means he needs something Arrow-like, and we see this as an opportunity to work together in America.

We are improving our capabilities, and we have a lot of lessons learned [after the Iranian attacks.]""

The Arrow system, developed jointly with the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, is Israel‚Äôs top defense against long-range missile threats. 

In April and October, it intercepted hundreds of Iranian missiles, proving its effectiveness in real combat. 

IAI is also looking to sell Arrow to the UAE and other Gulf nations, but any deal would require U.S. approval, since Washington helped develop the system. 

With tensions rising and global demand for missile defense increasing, Arrow could soon have a much bigger role beyond Israel.

FourVork,"How to get a job in web3

This is the only resource you will need to get a job in crypto

There are 2 ways to get a job: 

1) The conventional way: Applying with CV etc
2) The smarter way: Growing your network

Let's discuss both

1) The conventional way:

- You fix your CV, tailor it for every application, and apply to as many jobs as possible.

- The problem? Competition is insane. You're up against thousands of others. Unless you have a standout portfolio or direct connections, you‚Äôll probably get ghosted.

You can still use this method. If you're going this route, here are the best crypto job listing platforms:

a) cryptojobslist com (more defi related, startup and inferiorish jobs too)
b) jobs a16z com (more high end and US compensations.)
c) web3 career
d) remote3 co
e) cryptocurrencyjobs co/web3/ 
f) wellfound com/jobs 
g) jobs solana com/jobs

Now let's discuss the Smarter way

2) The smarter way:

Your network is your net worth: but not in the clich√© way. 

The people you engage with daily will determine the opportunities you get. Here‚Äôs how you actually build that network and make yourself valuable:

1) Start doing the work before you get hired

- Get your hands dirty: yield farming, airdrops, testnets, trading, NFTs - whatever part of the industry interests you.

- Share your process. Post consistently. Break down what you learn. Help others understand it.

2)  Learn fundamentals while building your presence

- The more you know, the more valuable your content becomes.

- Go deep. Understand the mechanics, and your insights will stand out.

- The better your fundamentals, the more prepared you‚Äôll be when the right opportunity comes. Learn the basics of blockchain, how PoW and PoS work under the hood, learn basics of defi, how AMMs work, how to do R:R for yield farming etc. Get your hands dirty and keep learning

3) Monetize while you learn

- Platforms like Kaito pay for posting. Some of their leaderboards (Polkadot, Skate, Quai, Lombard, Infinex, etc.) reward top contributions.

- Pick a leaderboard, spend time studying the tech, and start writing about it.

- You get paid, you build expertise, and you grow your presence - all at the same time.

4) Engage with the right people

- Find the key community members of projects you‚Äôre interested in. 

- Go to project's kaito leaderboard, go over the accounts, and start connecting and replying to some of those guys and other community members, to integrate into that community.

- Join discussions, reply to their posts, and add value.

- When you‚Äôre consistently visible in a niche, opportunities will start coming to you.

5) Results

Thus you will increase your media presence, improve your writing skills, and improve your fundamentals. 

Plus you will potentially get the rewards from Kaito.  

And the connections you will get will help land some entry level web3 jobs like discord mod. That experience, connections, and knowledge will prepare you more for better jobs.

Why this works:

A few weeks after I started consistently posting quality content on twitter, I got a job offer. That‚Äôs how crypto hiring actually happens: through visibility and reputation.

Your first opportunity might be a community role like Discord mod, but that‚Äôs a start. From there, you‚Äôll gain experience, get connection, and level up into better jobs.

Most people fail because they give up too early. The ones who keep learning, posting, and engaging eventually find the right fit.

This is the long game. Play it right, and you‚Äôll attract job offers instead of chasing them.

EricCLFung,"I have to be honest: 
a huge part of why people are pushing AI and by extension, crypto-based AI agents infra is because there‚Äôs money to be made.

It feels like a new wave of tech frenzy, with fresh projects and ICOs and IPOs emerging almost daily. The growth of AI combined with crypto agents will depend heavily on the capital that flows into these projects. 

Once the hype is over, everything dumps. 

I‚Äôm not saying these technologies lack value or can‚Äôt evolve, but I do worry they could tighten the grip of ‚ÄúBig Tech‚Äù and large-scale corporate interests on our everyday lives. 

I realize this comparison might not be perfect, but I‚Äôm already seeing less original content on social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok. Instead, there‚Äôs been a surge in reaction videos to other people‚Äôs material. Sure, they can be funny or entertaining, but they also point to a growing complacency. Maybe thats why a platform like KAITO and YAPs work so well.

By way of background, I‚Äôve bought my crypto in the web3 space since 2018. I‚Äôve built a few AI chatbots on my own, and my current startup uses AI to aggregate and validate genuine investors and startup connections. I‚Äôve also invested in multiple A.I. and web3 blockchain ventures, and I worked at a blockchain AGI company for the past year. I‚Äôm fortunate to have sold and exited my first startup about eight years ago. Even now, helping under stealth on a Web3 AI project.

Now, as I look to the future, I‚Äôm worried about what this all means for things like essays, papers, and even our children‚Äôs writing skills.

JoshuaTobkin,"I asked Grok to summarize the AutoFi thread, here it is: 

Summary of Joshua D. Tobkin‚Äôs AutoFi Thread
On March 6, 2025, at 04:45 UTC, Joshua D. Tobkin, associated with Supra, introduced AutoFi, a groundbreaking concept for decentralized finance (DeFi) on blockchains, particularly within Supra‚Äôs Layer 1 (L1) ecosystem. AutoFi represents a paradigm shift in blockchain revenue generation, moving away from traditional reliance on transaction fees and token inflation toward a self-sustaining financial engine powered by automated arbitrage and liquidations at the protocol level.

This summary explores the key ideas, technical details, economic implications, and community reactions to AutoFi within the broader context of DeFi and blockchain economics.

1. Introduction to AutoFi: A New DeFi Paradigm
Tobkin opens by questioning whether blockchains can generate substantial revenue without relying on transaction fees and whether Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bots‚Äîwhich manipulate transaction ordering for profit‚Äîcan be eliminated. He presents AutoFi as the solution: an automated system that captures value typically extracted by MEV bots and redistributes it within the ecosystem.

Revenue Distribution:

25% to dApps: Funds DeFi innovation by creating a new revenue stream for builders.

25% to Validators: Pays validators through automation profits instead of inflation or MEV extraction.

50% to the Network Treasury: Strengthens the blockchain‚Äôs financial position, enabling growth and liquidity without inflation.

By eliminating fee dependence, MEV middlemen, and inflationary mechanics, AutoFi positions blockchains as economically unstoppable financial engines.

2. Problems with Traditional Blockchain Models
Tobkin critiques the current blockchain revenue model, identifying three major flaws:

Unpredictable and Insufficient Fees ‚Äì Transaction fees fluctuate with network activity, making them unreliable.
MEV Extraction ‚Äì MEV bots drain millions from users, creating unfairness and centralization risks.
Inflationary Pressure ‚Äì Many L1s issue new tokens to sustain operations, diluting token value.
He argues this model is unsustainable, setting the stage for AutoFi as a transformative alternative.

3. How AutoFi Works: Technical and Economic Innovations

AutoFi internalizes revenue through automated DeFi mechanisms:

Auto-Arbitrage: Captures price inefficiencies across markets, removing MEV bots from the equation.
Auto-Liquidations: Executes liquidations efficiently, ensuring DeFi system stability.

Same-Block Execution: Transactions, including arbitrage and liquidations, settle within a single block, minimizing MEV opportunities.

This revenue is then redistributed to dApps, validators, and the network treasury, aligning incentives across the ecosystem.

AutoFi‚Äôs economic impact includes:

Validators earn sustainable revenue without MEV reliance.

dApps gain a new revenue model beyond swaps or yield farming.

The Network Treasury builds a high-frequency revenue engine, funding ecosystem expansion without inflation.
This ""flywheel effect"" creates momentum‚Äîmore activity drives more revenue, improving execution, fueling further growth, and reducing reliance on external funding.

4. AutoFi‚Äôs Broader Implications for DeFi and Blockchain Economics

AutoFi‚Äôs introduction carries major implications for the blockchain industry:

Economic Sustainability ‚Äì Replaces fee-based and inflationary models with an automated revenue engine, reducing volatility.

Fairness & Equity ‚Äì Eliminates extractive MEV practices, making DeFi more inclusive and efficient.

Innovation & Adoption ‚Äì Encourages dApp development and validator participation, accelerating growth.
Competitive Edge ‚Äì Positions Supra ahead of Ethereum, Solana, and other L1s still struggling with MEV and fee issues.

5. Community Reactions
The thread received enthusiastic engagement from the crypto community, highlighting its potential:

@kryp_carlos: ""Are we still going to the moon? üöÄüöÄ"" ‚Üí Tobkin responds, reinforcing Supra‚Äôs trajectory.
@cryptoexpo2024: Calls AutoFi an ""ambitious DeFi concept"", highlighting its potential to capture MEV for the ecosystem.
@mickey_web3: Emphasizes AutoFi‚Äôs ability to remove MEV actors while enhancing fair execution and rewards.
@MangPwit: Praises Supra‚Äôs vision, predicting value appreciation for $SUPRA.
These reactions validate AutoFi‚Äôs game-changing potential, reinforcing its disruptive nature in DeFi.

6. Conclusion
Joshua D. Tobkin presents AutoFi as a revolutionary shift in blockchain economics, turning automated arbitrage and liquidations into a sustainable financial engine.

By capturing MEV revenue and redistributing it to dApps, validators, and the treasury, AutoFi eliminates reliance on fees or inflation, making Supra a self-sustaining economic powerhouse.

With strong community backing and a bold vision, AutoFi could drive mass adoption‚Äîthough challenges in execution, governance, and industry adoption remain.

As of March 2025, AutoFi positions Supra as a leader in the DeFi Revolution, offering a new blueprint for blockchain financial systems.","""1898607337826308508""","1082499390240022528"

Yesterday, President Trump and Bestie David Sacks hosted a Crypto Summit at the White House, further affirming his administration's support for cryptocurrencies.

The President issued an executive order establishing two initiatives: the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, intended to hold seized Bitcoin indefinitely without selling, and a digital asset stockpile for other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and XRP, which can be managed or sold by the Treasury.

The Trump administration plans to revise and reintroduce the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which would define whether tokens are regulated by the SEC or CFTC. 

Stablecoins emerged as a key topic at the summit, with the administration viewing them as a path to maintaining U.S. dollar hegemony.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that U.S. dollar stablecoins should be fully backed by U.S. Treasuries and regularly audited, which could accelerate global adoption.

Storms are forming farther south than they used to, creeping about 345 miles down since 1979. 

That means more hurricanes slamming into the Caribbean, Central America, and parts of North America that aren‚Äôt built for them.

Weaker wind patterns are making it easier for storms to develop in these regions, and once they form, they‚Äôre hitting harder. 

Small island nations and coastal communities now face bigger risks with fewer resources to fight back.

The usual hurricane hotspots have spent decades preparing. These new targets? Not so much. 

The storms are coming, whether they‚Äôre ready or not.

CryptoStatuette,"Based Community Building 103 üîµ

Chapter 1: History

I‚Äôve mentioned that my background is highly unconventional compared to many in our industry and my position didn‚Äôt even exist at @base when I was hired. I‚Äôm a trained archaeologist and a professional ceramic sculptor. So, I‚Äôm often asked how I fell in love with the Based Builder community and dedicated my life to building the global onchain economy with them.

It all makes sense when viewed from my perspective which is shaped by my insights as an archaeologist, years of studying how societies evolve, adapt, and innovate over time. Studying ancient civilizations reveals one consistent truth: societies that fail to adapt to new paradigms collapse under their own rigidity. As Lao Tzu said, ‚ÄúThe hard and stiff will be broken, the soft and supple will prevail.‚Äù

I could clearly see that the same is true for the institutions of our age, and that decentralized blockchain technology is the solution to many of the challenges we face today.

After years of leadership roles in large crypto communities, I saw that what @base is building aligns most closely with my vision. So, I chose to commit to change, to be part of something greater than myself and to help build equal opportunities for EVERYONE across the globe. 

That‚Äôs where it all began.

Right now, we are experiencing the labor pains of a new global onchain economy, one that increases innovation, creativity, and freedom at an unprecedented scale. Those who cling to outdated, centralized models will become the boomers of the next century, relics of an era that failed to evolve.","""1898555119337177411""","1373330285211885570"

Sen Elizabeth Warren joined Texas Democrats in Austin, pushing the familiar message that democracy is in danger. 

Joining Reps Greg Casar and Lloyd Doggett, she fired up the crowd with attacks on her usual targets.

She railed against corporations, conservatives, and political opponents, painting them as threats to the country. 

The audience cheered, but in a state that hasn‚Äôt gone blue in decades, speeches won‚Äôt change the map.

Zeneca,"I round tripped 8 figures last cycle. A few things I learned:

- It‚Äôs almost always better to sell too early and miss out on gains, then to hold too long and round trip the bag. This is because eventually, almost everything trends to zero, so even your ‚Äúearly sell‚Äù is likely going to make you look like a genius in a few months/years

- If you ever take a PnL screenshot of how much you‚Äôre up, sell. You don‚Äôt have to sell your entire position, but it‚Äôs usually an excellent time to at least trim 20-50% of it.

- Most people on this app have absolutely no idea what they‚Äôre talking about. Often the loudest and most confident voices know the least, while the quiet and self questioning ones are full of wisdom.

- You can‚Äôt borrow conviction. If you buy something because someone else did or told you it was ‚Äúa hidden gem‚Äù, you‚Äôre almost guaranteed to fumble the bag. They‚Äôll dump on your head while you‚Äôre still anxiously waiting for their next tweet or YouTube video to tell you what to do.

- Stop trying to impress people. This is just good general life advice, but it applies triply so to this space. Wanting to impress your friends and family is one thing, wanted to impress random anons on the internet? Insanity.

- There‚Äôs Bitcoin, and then there‚Äôs everything else. It took me too long to truly realize this. Yes alts can and will occasionally outperform - sometimes for long stretches of time - but basically everything bleeds to Bitcoin over the long run. 

- Most people try to outperform Bitcoin by trading these alts; probably leas than 5% of people can actually accomplish this. It‚Äôs like trying to outperform the S&P 500. Most people are better off just buying the index.

- This place has a way of warping your perspective to a level that is literally bordering on mental illness. Many of us refused to sell jpegs of a list of words for $50,000 last cycle because we thought ‚Äúit‚Äôs undervalued‚Äù. Many otherwise smart people. You are not immune. Herd mentality is real, it takes *a lot* to swim against the current around here. You should try.

- Extending from that point, try and zoom out and also spend time with non-crypto people. 1 SOL or 0.08 ETH can seem like not significant amounts of money (unit bias is real), but add up how much that is per day or year and think what you could do with that money IRL. Also, most people are thrilled to earn a 10% return on their investments in a YEAR, and rightfully so. That‚Äôs a great return, crypto just warps everything.

- Compound interest is mind boggling powerful. You don‚Äôt need to find a 100x, you‚Äôre usually way better off stringing together a bunch of 2x plays or even compounding at 10-50% a year (do the math, do you have any idea how insane compound interest is at high %s over a bunch of years?)

- Put another way: ‚ÄúMost people overestimate what they can achieve in a year and underestimate what they can achieve in ten years.‚Äù

V1 will be helping people get their time back keeping up with thousands of different news sources and deliver curated pertinent info to you based on your crypto gaming portfolio. 

So you can keep gaming, trading, and collecting. 

My design philosophy around the app is about empowering individuals and communities. 

Giving them ownership of their time and opportunities. 

To the builders, you will not be forgotten, I don‚Äôt want your hard blood, sweat, and tears in development fall on deaf ears. 

I want you to be heard and celebrated on your major milestones.

So should you decide what is valuable for your fundraising efforts?

it's important for everyone interested in raising capital to know that fundraising can be broken down into 2 main motions

1) showing people you're running a business that promises to do something they're interested in (different for different types of investors)

2) establishing trust / influence so they believe #1

Before you do anything in the name of fundraising, make sure you understand which category it falls into.

South Sudan‚Äôs fragile peace deal is unraveling as political arrests and military clashes raise fears of renewed war.

Security forces loyal to President Salva Kiir have detained top officials tied to Vice President Riek Machar, sparking outrage and warnings from the U.N. Human Rights Commission.

The White Army militia‚Äîa group linked to Machar‚Äôs ethnic base‚Äîhas also clashed with government forces, leaving dozens dead, including a South Sudanese general.

With the 2018 peace agreement at risk, the question remains: Will South Sudan slide back into war?

Truthcoin,"The fraud of the ""don't break Bitcoin"" crowd,
And,
why @darosior philosophy is evil:

Imagine a bad code change to Bitcoin -- its so bad, it breaks everything -- it immediately crashes the node (like an assert(0) error)

What would happen in the real world? If that were released?

Um, nothing -- no one would run it. No one would be * even able * to run it. If they ran it, it would crash -- they would think that they had failed to install the new software in the first place. 

(It would have the same status, as the millions of versions of Bitcoin Core that are hypothetical but never released -- unusable)

This is why (contra Luke Dashjr) it is **backwards compatibility** and **the legitimacy of past versions** which protect Bitcoin. It is NOT ****""the absence of change""**** (whatever that means, in a world of ever-changing OS, dependences, requirements, ever-longer blockchain, growing userbase etc).

It is also why the hard fork is bad. When laypeople (who don't know the difference between hard fork and soft fork) say ""don't change Bitcoin"", they are talking about the hard fork.  

A ""soft fork"" is no different than any other code change -- except that the new feature is not safe to use until after miners upgrade. The op nop style softforks (explicitly inserted by Satoshi for the exact purpose of being used for upgrades) in particular carry zero risk, since miners could simply edit their template to ban any problematic op code from ever being spent to/from and it would be exactly as if the softfork had never existed.

So that is why it is false. But why is it also evil?

Well, because the whole thing is a shakedown of course. It is a USSR style power grab to make sure that any Bitcoin development that is actually useful, ""goes through the proper channels"" -- aka @darosior is the master and everyone else is his slaves

They imagine a world where Bitcoin Core is prestigious -- like an ivy league university or something, and they themselves are special board members -- they are the socialites who determine who gets accepted to the school. Is a soft fork safe? You have to ask them, every time. They are the permanent gatekeepers.

A permanently corrupt anti-meritocracy. (When in reality it is mafia style racketeering where they both create the problem and sell the solution.)

The more important reason why it is evil - is that Bitcoin has not yet prevailed. BTC does not currently have 8 billion happy users. In that sense, BTC is ""broken"" today, right now. Our work (in fixing it) is still cut out for us. Bitcoin will only succeed through **hard work** -- otherwise it will die. And @darosior 's philosophy is fundamentally opposed to that work. It is a philosophy emphasizing inaction over action -- it is a philosophy of complacency, not hard work.","""1898443989365186819""","2229217944"

Happy International Women‚Äôs Day! 

On March 7, 1992 in Japan, the first episode of Sailor Moon (ÁæéÂ∞ëÂ•≥Êà¶Â£´„Çª„Éº„É©„Éº„É†„Éº„É≥, Bish≈çjo Senshi SƒìrƒÅ M≈´n) aired. The popularity of this anime (based on the manga by Naoko Takeuchi) stems partly from how it reimagined the ""magical girl"" genre to emphasize female empowerment and agency rather than just romance or passivity.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

Today we celebrate women, the women of our family and friends, mentors, leaders as well as the women who fight in wars right now and the honor of those innocent who lost their lives such as the victims of October 7, the Ukrainian women and those lost in the Israel-Palestine conflict, the mothers, the wives, the daughter. Now, more than ever, in a world of war and unrest, women have to step into empowerment and agency.

There are several valuable lessons we can learn from the Sailor Moon series:

1. Female friendship and solidarity - The series centers on a group of girls who support each other through challenges, showing the power of female friendship and teamwork. If you are looking for such a community, check https://t.co/zgtJ2cCgLO

2. Leadership development - Usagi (Sailor Moon) begins as a clumsy, reluctant hero but grows into a confident leader, demonstrating how leadership skills can be developed over time. A book you might find useful is Edge: Turning Adversity into Advantage by Laura Huang

3. Embracing femininity as strength - The series shows that traditionally feminine traits like compassion, empathy, and emotional intelligence are powerful strengths, not weaknesses. Check out the https://t.co/YMdI6mu0RC

4. Diverse representations of women - Each Sailor Scout has different personalities, interests, and strengths, showing there's no single way to be a strong woman. For public speaking, there is AI to coach you https://t.co/dNNqsETghS

5. Balance of vulnerability and strength - Characters can be emotional and vulnerable while still being powerful, showing that sensitivity and strength aren't mutually exclusive. Just do it https://t.co/X6JDcLwzaS

6. Self-acceptance - The characters learn to accept themselves, including their flaws and unique qualities, as part of their growth. Look within, Naikan

7. Standing up against injustice - The Sailor Scouts consistently fight against evil and protect the innocent, modeling moral courage and social responsibility. You have two choices, to do to other women what has been done to you (especially older women who lived in all male environments and have scars) or you can help other people and treat them the way you wished to be treated. Too often, senior women tear down young women and do not advocate for them. Don‚Äôt be one of the men; it‚Äôs not a zero-sum game deal, dear older women. Think, would I want someone to behave like this with my daughter?

Learn it and youre an unstoppable force

Here are 24 dead simple rules for building your following:

1. Send at least 1 post a day. Skipping a day lowers your algorithm score

2. Dont ask for anything from your audience. Exclusively give value

3. Formatting is everything. You can post the greatest idea in the world and if its unreadable nobody will look at it

4. Always proof read. Spelling and grammar mistakes come off as lazy. 

5. Proof read by reading your post out loud. You catch way more mistakes this way

6. Being on X all day can really damage your mental health. Limit yourself to only specific times

7. To be a good writer you need to be a good reader. Read books as much as you write posts. Better inputs = better outputs

8. When youre under 1000 followers keep your niche small. Be the loudest person in that niche

9. From 1000-5000 start expanding your niche. Interact with larger communities. Talk about broader subjects, but still stay in a niche

10. 5000-10000 you can start going for home runs. Youll be noticed now, so write more generalized tweets/threads about larger niches

11. Post with the same care and determination at 1 follower as you do at 1 million followers.

12. Form a pod. Choose 5 X accounts a similar size to you and interact with them every day. Youll grow together

13. Replying to other posts are critical. Reply to major accounts shortly after they post and youll get big exposure to a new audience

14. Always interact with people who reply to your posts. This is your core audience

15. Ignore the trolls. It's never worth it.

16. Speaking on an X Space every day will super charge your growth

17. Speaking of X Spaces: this is the most powerful tool in all of social media. Lose the fear and get on stage

18. Keep a notepad so you can write down ideas for posts throughout the day. The more you post, the more ideas youll get

19. If you live a busy life schedule your posts ahead of time. 

20. Be kind to others, itll naturally attract an audience to you much quicker

21. Monetizing too soon hurts your growth.

22. Quality over quantity. 1 quality post a day is better than 1000 throwaway posts

23. Enjoy the journey. It isnt about getting to a million followers. Its about the people you meet and the skills you learn along the way","""1898422461051322519""","1369348853414178822"

novogratz,"Crypto musings‚Ä¶

1. The announcements yesterday were huge.  Historical. That we have a $BTC reserve will send a message to every country.   This is a very big deal. 

2.  Allowing Banks to participate will greatly increase institutional adoption.  
This might be more important than the reserve.  

3. Hearing the Sec Treas talk about the importance of $USD stablecoins in keeping the dollar the world‚Äôs reserve currency tells me that we have a team that gets it.  Very Bullish stables. 

4 why has price of crypto been heavy in 2025.   To start we had a frenzy in Q4 that peaked into inauguration with a Crypto Ball.   Lots got priced in.  All these changes being made take time to implement and institutions move methodically.  Chinese crypto players have a white hot stock market to invest in. $BABA is outperforming any crypto by a lot this year.   We haven‚Äôt gotten a new ‚Äòkiller app‚Äô on Web3 that‚Äôs taken hold to drive narrative on L1‚Äôs like $ETH and $sol. 
Meme coin frenzy crashed with $Trump coin. US stocks which were priced for perfection being sold as people rotate out of America  exceptionalism into China and Europe.   

5.  What‚Äôs next . $BTC needs to retake 91k to regain momentum buyers.  Until then we are 75-90 range on charts.  
Rest of Crypto needs a retail Calvary.   What i do know is every time you think they are gone they come back.   Need to see that to get market turned around.  $ETH should hold 2k and needs to hold 2k.

beast_ico,"Increasingly these days wondering why it really matters if I believe in the tech from a crypto holder perspective‚Ä¶

For example - I believe all sorts of value was unlocked via the internet‚Ä¶but the value for investors and speculators is largely in picking the right companies to invest in, not holding the broadband company/etc‚Ä¶as they‚Äôre all commoditized at this point. 

Seems like the real ‚Äú10000x‚Äù in that arena is in building your own app/product and hoping to turn it into a unicorn.

From that lens, it‚Äôs becoming increasingly difficult to understand why if you really believe in Ethereum or other decentralized tech, why you wouldn‚Äôt sell all/most of your holdings and basically fund yourself trying to build something valuable on top of the platform‚Ä¶since that‚Äôs where the value actually accrues.

If I think back to my early days in crypto, ETH was marketed as the value accrual layer for the future internet‚Ä¶and to a degree it still has the markings of what could be the future decentralized internet. The problem is I see very little evidence of value accrual to it, despite having almost a decade of time to get that portion figured out.

We‚Äôve got a myriad of scaling ideas that have been built out, but none of them seem to be doing anything to meaningfully drive value back to the base asset.

Months after Bashar al-Assad was ousted, Syria is spiraling into a brutal new phase of conflict‚Äîthis time, with his own Alawite sect caught in the crossfire. What started as a fight against dictatorship is now looking more like a score-settling bloodbath.

Assad ruled Syria for decades with an iron grip, was toppled in December 2024 by an Islamist-led coalition.

His Alawite sect, a minority that dominated the military and government, is now facing violent reprisals.

For years, Alawites were seen as Assad‚Äôs enforcers, but with him gone, they‚Äôre increasingly being treated as the enemy.

Tensions exploded after security forces arrested an Alawite man in a small village, triggering deadly clashes.

What followed was a full-blown military operation in Syria‚Äôs coastal Alawite heartland.

The government claims it‚Äôs hunting down Assad loyalists.

But reports from the ground suggest something darker‚Äîexecutions, looting, and mass killings.

In just days, the number of Alawite civilians killed has jumped from 100 to over 340.

Many were reportedly executed.

The total death toll‚Äîincluding security forces and pro-Assad fighters‚Äîhas now surpassed 550.

The UN is condemning the violence, warning that Syria‚Äôs fragile transition is at risk of unraveling.

Meanwhile, Western powers and Syria‚Äôs neighbors are watching nervously, fearing a return to all-out sectarian warfare.

The new government, struggling to consolidate power, faces a dangerous test:

Can it bring stability without fueling another cycle of bloodshed?

Syria‚Äôs post-Assad future is looking less like a fresh start and more like a continuation of the nightmare‚Äîjust with different players in charge.

A new study reveals that German women earn, on average, 20% less after getting married‚Äîwhile men‚Äôs salaries remain completely unaffected.

The reason? Women work fewer hours or leave the workforce entirely, often due to outdated tax policies and traditional gender roles. 

One in ten women stop working after marriage, and even those without kids see their earnings shrink.

Meanwhile, men? 

No financial change at all. 

Researchers found women from former East Germany‚Äîwhere gender roles were historically more progressive‚Äîexperienced smaller income drops than those in the West.

Germany might pride itself on gender equality, but when marriage cuts a woman‚Äôs paycheck while leaving a man‚Äôs untouched, something‚Äôs clearly off.

NikkiSiapno,"Things every developer should know: JSON web token (JWT).

JWTs are one of the most widely used methods for API authentication, providing a secure, stateless and scalable way to verify clients.

Here‚Äôs a simple-to-understand breakdown of how it works, step by step:

1) Client authentication
The client (a user, app, or device) provides credentials (eg; username/password) to the authentication server.

2) Server verification
The authentication server checks the credentials against its database or identity provider to confirm their validity.

3) JWT issuance
If authentication is successful, the server:

‚òë Generates a JWT with claims (eg; user ID, roles, permissions).
‚òë Signs the JWT using a secret key (HS256) or a private key (RS256).

4) Token delivery
The server sends the signed JWT back to the client in the response.

5) Secure storage
The client stores the JWT securely to prevent unauthorized access. HTTP-only cookies are the most secure and widely used method.

6) API requests with JWT
For each request to a protected API, the client includes the JWT in the Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`

7) Server validates the JWT
The API server verifies the JWT before granting access by checking:

‚òë Signature ‚Äì Confirms token integrity (not tampered with).
‚òë Expiration ‚Äì Ensures the token hasn‚Äôt expired.
‚òë Audience (aud claim) ‚Äì Checks if the token is meant for this API.
‚òë Issuer (iss claim) ‚Äì Confirms the token was issued by a trusted authority.

If the JWT is valid, the server grants access to the requested resource. Otherwise, it rejects the request (401 Unauthorized).

8) Token expiration & refresh
Since JWTs expire for security reasons, the client needs a refresh token to get a new one:

‚Ü≥ Client sends refresh token to the server.
‚Ü≥ Server verifies & issues a new JWT if the refresh token is valid.
‚Ü≥ New JWT replaces the expired one, and the client continues making requests.

This workflow ensures secure, stateless, and efficient authentication for APIs while keeping performance and scalability in check.

Thom_Wolf,"Many are proposing ""move 37"" as evidence that AI has already reached Einstein-level intelligence, so I'd like to expand on this specific example.

Move 37, while impressive, is still essentially a straight-A student answer to the question posed by the rules of the game of Go.

Similarly, I'm quite convinced AI models will soon be able to come up with at least one formal mathematical proof that will be considered much more elegant than those developed by the best mathematicians to date.

But I don't think these truly qualify as the paradigm shifts we're discussing.

I believe an Einstein-level breakthrough in Go would involve something more fundamental, like inventing the rules of Go itself‚Äîexploring the vast landscape of possible game rules to create something genuinely more compelling than existing games.

Or in mathematics (a more apt analogy since games are human constructs unlike natural science), it might involve ""discovering connections between previously unrelated mathematical fields to propose a new area of fruitful mathematical research"" (which typically forms the basis of Fields Medal-winning work).

The bar for what constitutes an Einstein-level scientific paradigm shift remains really high in my opinion.","""1898321897093308540""","246939962"
CryptoTraalala,"Missed Uniswap? Don't make the same mistake twice.

Ekubo is everything Uniswap should have been, but even better. Faster, cheaper, and more efficient.

And it's already live on Starknet and Ethereum.

Don't sleep on this üëá

1. What is @EkuboProtocol

Ekubo is a concentrated liquidity market maker on @Starknet.

It allows liquidity providers to concentrate their funds within specific price ranges, making trading more efficient with lower slippage and better capital efficiency.

Basically, Ekubo is a better version of Uniswap on Starknet and Ethereum.

2. Why is Ekubo Better And What Set it Apart ?

EkuboProtocol is designed to improve Uniswap‚Äôs model in several key areas, particularly in gas efficiency, capital efficiency, and customization:

1‚É£ Gas Efficiency: Lower Fees for Traders and LPs

‚Ä¢ Singleton Contract Design

Unlike traditional AMMs where each pool has a separate smart contract, Ekubo manages all pools within a single contract.

This means when you interact with multiple pools in a single transaction (e.g., swapping across different token pairs), you don‚Äôt need to call multiple contracts and therefore saving gas.

In a result, Ekubo is about 20% cheaper than Uniswap v3 and v4 for simple swaps, and even more cost-effective for multi-step swaps. Therefore, providers can earn better returns without needing as much capital as on other platforms.

2‚É£ The ‚ÄúTill‚Äù Pattern

Normally, every swap or liquidity update involves immediate token transfers, which increase gas costs.

Instead, Ekubo defers token transfers until the end of the transaction, batching them together for efficiency.

Result: Swaps and liquidity management on Ekubo are cheaper than on other AMM, making it more attractive for high-frequency traders and LPs.

Ekubo is always one step ahead as these innovations were only implemented only in Uniswap V4, making Ekubo a pioneer in introducing them.

3‚É£ Concentrated liquidity

Even though Uniswap v4 improves gas efficiency, Ekubo still has a 100 X smaller tick size than Uniswap, meaning liquidity is much more concentrated. It means $1,000 in liquidity on Ekubo works as effectively as $100K on other AMMs.

LPs can focus their capital within a specific price range, increasing capital efficiency.

In traditional AMMs, liquidity is spread evenly across all possible prices, meaning a large portion of liquidity remains unused (except if the market price moves significantly)

Ekubo uses concentrated liquidity, allowing LPs to provide liquidity only within a specific price range of their choice. This means:

‚Ä¢ LPs can allocate their capital more efficiently to the price ranges where most trading occurs.

‚Ä¢ Traders get better price execution with lower slippage since more liquidity is available at the trading price.

‚Ä¢  LPs earn higher returns because their capital is actively used rather than sitting and being unused.

While Uniswap V4 optimizes Uni tick size, the extent of those optimizations still not match Ekubo's in terms of how concentrated and efficient liquidity can be deployed within smaller ranges.

4‚É£ Withdrawal Fee Incentives for LPs

Ekubo employs a fee switch mechanism that charges a fee on liquidity provider (LP) withdrawals equal to the fee tier of the pool. This creates a unique incentive for LPs to stay in the pool longer and allows the protocol to generate revenue.

In the future, as the protocol continues to grow, Ekubo will likely use its TWAMM (Time-Weighted Automated Market Maker) extension to automate buybacks of $EKUBO using protocol revenue, with the repurchased tokens being distributed to stakers with a model significantly more attractive compared to Uniswap‚Äôs fee switch which focuses on redistributing trading fees for governance and token value enhancement.

5‚É£ DCA Feature

Ekubo offers a feature called DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) via its first extension, the TWAMM (Time-Weighted Average Market Maker), which enables users to execute token sales over a specified time period. This feature is available in the user interface as ""DCA orders"" and ""DCA-enabled"" pools.

Great thread about Ekubo‚Äôs DCA: https://t.co/tXsbr7Z1b0

6‚É£ Permissionless Extensions for Developers

Ekubo allows developers to create custom pool types, such as on-chain oracles or limit orders. This enables more flexibility and customization for advanced DeFi strategies, while Uniswap v4 introduces some flexibility, but Ekubo's focus on permissionless extensions provides more room for custom DeFi products.

7‚É£ Multihook

Multihook makes Ekubo more powerful by allowing multiple upgrades (extensions) to be added to a single liquidity pool instead of just one. This means developers can mix and match different features, control how they work together, and test new ideas without having to rebuild the pool from scratch. With support for up to 16 extensions, Multihook makes DeFi on Ekubo more flexible, customizable, and ready for advanced improvements like A51 Carbon (an initiative by Ekubo Protocol focused on advanced liquidity customization)

8‚É£ Open Source Privacy Pools for Starknet

Ekubo has open-sourced an implementation of Privacy Pools for Starknet, inspired by the Privacy Pools concept introduced by Vitalik Buterin and others as an evolution of Tornado Cash.

Privacy Pools aim to balance financial privacy with regulatory compliance by allowing users to prove their funds originate from a legitimate set of deposits without revealing specific details.

By bringing this feature to Starknet, Ekubo invites the community to contribute to a more private (but compliant) financial ecosystem.

3. Ekubo Token and DAO

The EKUBO token has a total supply of 10 million tokens, distributed equally across three categories:

‚Ä¢ Airdrop: 1/3 of the supply was distributed to users

‚Ä¢ Team: 1/3 of the supply was distributed to the team

‚Ä¢ DAO: 1/3 of the supply was distributed to the DAO and was sold to buy ETH, USDC, and STRK using Ekubo‚Äôs DCA order feature

The Ekubo protocol is fully owned and operated by the DAO, with core contracts under its control rather than a multisig, reinforcing its commitment to decentralization.

Both the airdrop and team allocations were fully vested at TGE, while the DAO‚Äôs portion was sold gradually after which EKUBO became fully diluted.

The DAO sale raised over $3 million combined with the DAO‚Äôs revenue and the Starknet Catalyst grant where Ekubo was the top recipient with 6 Millions STRK received (=approx. $4.2M at that time)

Ekubo, Inc. is the creator of Ekubo Protocol, and the Ekubo DAO.

To sustain its role in the ecosystem, the company requested a $1.5M grant from the DAO to fund operations for the next two years, ensuring continued development without further funding.

Key Commitments:

‚Ä¢ Develop & maintain core Ekubo contracts (including Cairo updates)

‚Ä¢ Launch an on-chain limit order extension

‚Ä¢ Design a revenue distribution framework for EKUBO stakers (Q1 2025)

‚Ä¢ Host & maintain the Ekubo Interface (free for users)

‚Ä¢ Provide governance tooling, developer support, and public API access

‚Ä¢ Never sell the company's allocated 33.3% EKUBO tokens

The DAO will transfer $1.5M in ETH, STRK, and USDC to fund these efforts, covering 3-4 full-time hires.

$EKUBO Token:

For months EKUBO traded at 1$ / $EKUBO offering users the opportunity to buy at very low prices, and is now trading at >5X compared to its price at TGE, which is without any doubt a MASSIVE performance.

Ekubo does not rely only on their token. Their diversified approach improves financial stability and transparency.

Additionally, Ekubo's sale structure guaranteed that public buyers received the same terms as insiders, without later token unlocks, addressing the common concern that new tokens are often dominated by private market allocations.

4. Ekubo Adoption

While Volume and TVL stagnate for Ekubo, it is the same for Uni, mostly due to current market conditions

Furthermore, Ekubo has recently launched on Ethereum, which is expected to enhance its metrics and further its ambition to expand across other EVM chains. DEX aggregators on Ethereum, such as @matchaxyz, have already integrated Ekubo.

With projects like RosettaNET bringing EVM wallets to Starknet and the development of the Open Intent Framework, users will soon be able to seamlessly switch between chains, using their favorite wallets on Ekubo with ease.

5. What‚Äôs next ?

‚Ä¢ Focus on Ethereum for the next few months

‚Ä¢ TWAMM extension on Ethereum

‚Ä¢ Limit order extension

‚Ä¢ Deploying on other EVM chains

6. Why Will Ekubo Succeed ?

As Uniswap, Ekubo
‚úî Is Capital-Efficient AMM 
‚úî Is Decentralized / DAO-led governance, ensuring community control.
‚úî Has Strong Token Incentives
‚úî Has User-Centric interface

But Better, Because: 

üåü Deployed on Starknet: Lower Fees, Higher Throughput

Unlike Uniswap on Ethereum, Ekubo benefits from ultra-low transaction costs and high scalability, making it more accessible for traders and LPs.

üåü Improved Capital Efficiency

Advanced concentrated liquidity mechanisms and on-chain limit orders give liquidity providers more control and better returns than Uniswap v4.

üåü Modular and Flexible Architecture

Ekubo is designed to evolve rapidly, allowing for permissionless DeFi innovation and easy integration of new liquidity strategies and optimizations.

üåü Cross-Chain Expansion

With its Ethereum expansion and plans for multi-chain support.

hmalviya9,"Temple Scams in India

I went to Kashi Vishwanath Temple today. I met someone at the entrance who was a Pandit. 

He proposed a quicker darshan for us and didn‚Äôt ask for any price‚Äîhe said we could give whatever we liked after the darshan and to think of it as a donation to a Brahmin. In my mind, I thought I would give him ‚Çπ500, and that would be fine.

But before we reached the darshan, he stopped us at a shop where he somehow tricked us into buying some pooja items that cost ‚Çπ1,100. Then we walked towards the temple. 

The route was still the same as the one taken by others; he was just moving us through the line faster. 

We waited in the queue for an hour, then did our darshan. After that, he took us to another temple in the same corridor, where he made us sit in front of another Pandit.

This Pandit chanted some mantras and then started asking for a ‚Çπ4,400 donation. I told him I had no money and that this was not something we had intended to do willingly, so why were they forcing us? 

I walked away from that place and told the first Pandit that they couldn‚Äôt force us to donate, especially by playing this trick. He then tried to justify it with some ridiculous arguments about donations.

By the end of the whole darshan, when I gave him ‚Çπ500, the same guy who had said any donation was fine started asking for ‚Çπ2,100. He tried his best, and I ended up giving him ‚Çπ1,100. I ended up spending ‚Çπ2,200 on something I would call a scam that these guys are running in all major temples in India. 

They easily make ‚Çπ3,000 per day using the same trick, which amounts to around ‚Çπ90,000 every month‚Äî‚Çπ1 million per year. You can easily find at least 100 such Pandits in the top 100 Indian temples. The scam force is around 10,000 people, extracting nearly ‚Çπ10 billion every year from tourists in the name of quick darshan.

And yet, tourists like me are also at fault. Not because we deserve to be scammed, but because we have fallen into a cycle where we demand shortcuts. 

The same mind that gets impatient while standing in a queue at a temple is the same mind that taps ‚ÄúSkip Ad‚Äù the moment it appears, the same mind that looks for express delivery even when regular delivery would do just fine. 

We have trained ourselves to crave speed, to avoid waiting, to get what we want instantly. And when someone exploits that craving, we fall for it without realizing we are being played. 

The irony is that we willingly pay for an illusion of privilege‚Äîthe illusion that we are getting special access when, in reality, we are just another customer being processed through a well-oiled system of manipulation.

This is where the difference between serving demand and exploiting demand becomes clear. 

Take the lassi shop I visited later in Kashi. They sell around ‚Çπ3,000 worth of lassi every 10 minutes, easily making ‚Çπ60 million per year, just by selling lassi. But there‚Äôs no trickery there. 

No emotional manipulation. No false sense of exclusivity. They provide a product, and people pay for it because they genuinely want it. That‚Äôs serving demand.

But what these Pandits are doing is something else. They aren‚Äôt offering a service; they are feeding off people‚Äôs impatience, off their vulnerability, off their desire to feel special. 

They have created an invisible tax on devotion‚Äîa tax paid not in official currency, but in the currency of psychological manipulation. 

The tourist thinks they are getting something extra, but in reality, they are being led through the same corridors, standing in the same lines, just with a false sense of urgency and superiority.

And that‚Äôs the problem‚Äînot just here, but everywhere. The market for instant gratification is far bigger than the market for genuine services. 

Because while people may hesitate to spend money on things they truly need, they rarely hesitate to spend money on things that make them feel like they are skipping the line.","""1898310461755457665""","84375672"

game_for_one,"""It‚Äôs a Great Project"" Doesn‚Äôt Mean It‚Äôs a Great Investment/Trade

Seen this cycle before - when markets shift into a less risk-on phase, people start justifying why they‚Äôre still holding certain tokens. ‚ÄúThe team is still building.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt has a great roadmap.‚Äù Howard Marks puts it well: just because something is great doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a great buy.

Projects - especially those higher up the ""innovation"" curve - run on narratives and flows. When risk appetite is high, people extrapolate the future, bidding up projects with strong teams and ambitious roadmaps, often well beyond fair value. But when conditions shift, those same projects can grind lower, regardless of fundamentals. There's an inverse correlation between duration premium (how much investors are willing to price in the long-term) and risk-off sentiment - when uncertainty rises, the market discounts the future harder.

It‚Äôs not that the project suddenly became worse (though this happens, especially when the token is already live - morale drops, teams lose motivation, some give up). It‚Äôs that people become less creative when things look bad. The same speculators, investors who once speculated on a big future now hesitate to price in anything beyond the present.

So the real question isn‚Äôt just ‚ÄúIs this a good project?‚Äù but rather:
1) Is the market currently in a mode where it‚Äôs willing to price in the future? If so, how much of that future is already accounted for in the current valuation?
2) Are there actual buyers, or just people waiting for conditions to improve?","""1898268608070897841""","1424275360250748928"

Today, we honor the extraordinary women who are not just designing clothes, but crafting a more sustainable, ethical, and inclusive future for the fashion industry. Their dedication to positive change is truly inspiring. 

üëó @anitadongre (House of Anita Dongre Limited): A trailblazer advocating for women's empowerment through her elegant and contemporary designs. 

üåø Yael Aflalo (@Reformation): Revolutionizing fashion with a powerful commitment to sustainability and eco-conscious practices. 

‚ôªÔ∏è @StellaMcCartney (Stella McCartney): Setting the standard for ethical luxury, prioritizing environmental stewardship and animal welfare. 

üåç Caroline Brown (@EILEENFISHERNY): Crafting timeless, sustainable clothing designed for longevity and mindful consumption. 

üëö Pukhraj Ranjan (Moi Namaste): Empowering artisans and communities through handmade, ethically produced fashion and lifestyle items. 

üå± Mackenzie Yeates (@kotn): Redefining essential products with ethically sourced materials and designs that enhance quality of life. 

These women are not just creating beautiful garments; they are weaving a narrative of change, demonstrating that fashion can be a force for good. They are proof that style and sustainability can go hand-in-hand, and that ethical practices are not just a trend, but the future of our industry. 

Let's celebrate their achievements and continue to support their vision for a more responsible and equitable fashion world!

Scobleizer,"Grok mistake:

It got something very basic wrong about me. I asked it where I live.

Funny that Grok doesn't know where I live, even though I  list where I do on my X Profile and have talked about this many times here on X.

It was just one example that came up in an interesting conversation with @JoshuaJBouw and @bendiken about trustworthiness in AI and crypto (Joshua created the first proof of stake system). They visited my home, are visiting from Dubai.

Arto sees the world of AI needing to move to a new kind of AI that validates data and understands how it changes over time (and he's building such a system). Like my address. Most websites say I live in Half Moon Bay, because I did for 12 years, but Grok isn't smart enough to put together that my profile is more relevant for that than all the other data that built its LLM. 

Shows that Grok isn't strongly integrated here on X yet, too. I can't wait until it is, would love to have it watch my lists.

udiWertheimer,"why now is REALLY the time to upgrade bitcoin

i‚Äôve been obsessively talking about the need to upgrade bitcoin for a while now. but in the last 2-3 months, i was slightly less obsessive than before.

i will now become obsessive again. here‚Äôs why.

as the market was anticipating the possibility of the US government plowing trillions of dollars into a strategic bitcoin reserve, i think the odds of an upgrade reduced dramatically. in a scenario where a buyer with unlimited ammo decides to buy as much btc as possible, there‚Äôs probably going to be very little interest in making any changes to what seems like a winning formula.

but now, i think the market is coming to terms with the fact that this isn‚Äôt happening. at least not anytime soon.

instead, the government will maintain a pro-innovation stance, will stay out of our way, and will also stop selling bitcoin! maybe it‚Äôll even acquire some symbolic amounts. all of those things are great.

but it also means that as the federal government is probably not buying trillions of dollars worth of bitcoin anytime soon, bitcoiners will be in search for a new catalyst. this happens every cycle.

and we believe this new catalyst will be OP_CAT.

alongside a more friendly regulatory framework, OP_CAT will enable bitcoin projects to offer stronger privacy, fast and cheap transactions, self-custody for everyone, bitcoin-backed stablecoins, and everything else satoshi imagined.

my prediction is that over the next few months, the conversation in bitcoin will shift from DC to GitHub, and the community will come together to discuss what the next upgrade to bitcoin should look like.

it‚Äôs time to get obsessive again. it‚Äôs time to prove to satoshi that he left the project in good hands and that we can finish the job that he started. it‚Äôs time to bring back the CAT.

@the_weso built a profitable defi product with sustainable revenue. very rare in crypto when most defi products are just forks.

@DeFiDave22 is a seasoned defi builder who has built an audience via years of genuine / fun/ educational content. also eth bushwick is sick

last but not least, oppa @stablejae , the big brain researcher who sees everything, understands complex mechanisms and most importantly always brings good vibes no matter how tough the convos are

The Arc litepaper v1 is now live. The design of arc, handshake, registry, forge and ryzome has taken a tremendous amount of collective effort‚Äîfrom the engineers and designers working around the clock, to the advisors pushing us toward clarity, to the Arc Angels whose passion keeps the complex moving forward. It‚Äôs an honor to see everything come together.

There is a lot to unpack in the litepaper, but here is a summary of what's covered and why we're excited about the next phase of the arc ecosystem.

AI has been evolving fast‚Äîfrom clever chatbots to autonomous agents capable of real-world impact. Yet we‚Äôre still missing a fluid way for AI to integrate with our daily lives. We see a future where AI doesn‚Äôt just advise us on, say, finding a cheaper flight, but handles the entire booking process end to end. For that to happen, agents must connect seamlessly to thousands of services and handle payments in a way that makes sense to both crypto natives and everyday users.

That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre introducing Ryzome, our universal ‚Äúapp store‚Äù for agentic AI. Ryzome leverages Anthropic‚Äôs Model Context Protocol‚Äîthink ‚ÄúHTTP for AI‚Äù‚Äîso agents can access just about any Web2 or Web3 service. Meanwhile, Arc token powers the economics under the hood, rewarding service providers with 85% of transaction fees, sending 10% to grow the ecosystem, and reserving 5% to keep the lights on.

But there‚Äôs more. For end users who would rather pay in USD or with a credit card, that‚Äôs fine. The system automatically converts to Arc, then pays the service providers on the backend. You get simplicity; service providers get trust and transparency.

We believe this will open up real possibilities for both developers and end users. The Arc Handshake program gives devs a fast track to launch AI services on Ryzome. They‚Äôll reach a global audience via ever expanding distribution channels and plug into a library of composable AI tools, all while enjoying a fair revenue split. For you‚Äîthe person who wants a personal finance manager, an all-in-one travel planner, or an automated research assistant‚Äîit means a smarter, more unified experience.

The result, we hope, is a transformative ecosystem:
‚Äî Agents that actually do things, not just suggest them.
‚Äî A stronger Arc economy that aligns everyone‚Äôs incentives.
‚Äî A community-driven push toward a truly agentic future.

Take a moment to read the litepaper. We‚Äôre excited for you to see how Ryzome, Arc, and the broader ecosystem fit together. This is just the beginning of making AI not only smart, but capable‚Äîtruly capable‚Äîof changing how we live and work.

Thank you for being part of this journey.

it's hard to avoid becoming a maxi

look around ct

chain maxis, defi maxis, memecoin maxis, cartoon maxis, btc maxis, even eth maxis (retards)

the single greatest thing you can do for yourself as a crypto participant is simple

never become a maxi

ever

losing proposition

you need to be able to remain objective and you need to be able to move like water

it's a lot easier to learn one thing once and than it is to learn something new all the time

it's also a lot easier to insulate yourself in an echo chamber of other maxis than leave your comfort zone and re-establish yourself over and over in different places

that's why everyone on ct is a maxi of 'something'

99% aren't built for success, and cannot change and adapt over and over and over at light speed

yes, even you mr npc commenting below

It has been my home for the past 2 years, and we have become a family of best friends

The ethos is simple - give more than you take

This is why they have become a backbone of web3 gaming

I've never seen a group of more talented, selfless, hard-working people than WolvesDAO

All they want to do is add value to this industry

Yes, it's inevitable, but someone has to do the work

Many amazing groups and projects are doing incredible work in the space, and the common thread amongst all of them are ties back to WolvesDAO

I want to thank Payton, Sam, Sparkc, and the core team for everything they do

I've witnessed first-hand their work, passion, dedication, character, and integrity

It's my honor and privilege to build alongside them - honestly, it's a dream come true

Wolves launching $WOOF is a major milestone

They've been laying the groundwork, paying their dues, watching and learning for this moment

WOOF represents the best of the best in web3 gaming

It's a culture token built upon a 3-year foundation of passion, blood, sweat, tears, and dedication

It's a community token built upon hard work and giving back to gaming events, groups and guilds, and conferences all over the world

It's a gaming token tied to real products and people who commit their lives to making this industry better and uplifting the people doing great things

It's the start of a new chapter for WolvesDAO to build products and welcome more people into the family

Tokens will do what tokens do but the bond in WolvesDAO is something special and if the past 2-3 years is any indication of the power and impact of this group, then you should be very excited about this next phase

real_vijay,".@andrewrsorkin seems unsure how the US government could buy Bitcoin in a budget neutral way. There are a number of ways that more Bitcoin could be acquired:

- Asset Forfeiture:
The U.S. government already seizes Bitcoin through criminal and civil asset forfeiture. Expanding and streamlining these processes could increase the amount of Bitcoin acquired.

This is budget-neutral as the assets are obtained through legal proceedings, not direct purchases.

- Revaluation of Existing Assets:

There have been discussions about revaluing existing government assets, such as gold reserves, to current market prices. The increased valuation could create a ""surplus"" that could then be used to acquire Bitcoin.

- Strategic Sale of Non-Essential Assets:
The government could identify and sell non-essential assets, such as certain stockpiled commodities (our ""strategic cheese reserve"" üòÖ) or underutilized properties (Yellowstone national park - I kid, I kid!), and use the proceeds to purchase Bitcoin.

@BitcoinPierre  has quipped that if you own a chair, you don't own enough Bitcoin (you should be standing more and sitting less). Obviously this is being a little flippant, but the idea has truth to it: if something is non-productive or has little growth potential, why not sell it and acquire the best performing asset of the last decade?

Building great tech doesn‚Äôt guarantee a successful token. Founders, especially the ones who are here for the long game, are stuck in an impossible balancing act, pushing real innovation while constantly managing the community‚Äôs expectations around token price. Ignore the token, and you‚Äôre accused of neglecting your holders. Focus too much on it, and suddenly, you‚Äôre another pump and dump project with no real vision.

This dynamic forces founders into a cycle where survival depends not just on building something valuable, but also on keeping up with market narratives, speculation, and short-term hype. And let‚Äôs be real, many projects don‚Äôt even try to fight this. They lean into the casino model because it‚Äôs easier. Play the right meta, spin up a narrative, pump the token, exit.

But blockchain as a tech has so much more to offer. Yet the space is still largely driven by speculative trading. The sad reality? We‚Äôre not just competing on tech; we‚Äôre competing on attention. And in a market that moves this fast, attention always shifts to the next shiny thing.

So the question is 
WHEN DO WE BREAK THIS ? When do we stop optimizing for hype and start optimizing for real adoption? Because at some point, if we don‚Äôt, we risk proving the skeptics right: that we built an industry more focused on narratives than real-world impact","""1898052363182915622""","1034155709779271680"

dgt10011,"If being popular was my goal, I‚Äôd jump on the cheerleading bandwagon for the announced strategic reserve as a game-changer like everyone else. Of course I am thrilled at the idea of a strategic reserve in the US where bitcoin is finally being recognized. But as someone who at times must be contrarian in seeking alpha, here are my thoughts for the many who follow me because I speak my mind for which I hope you‚Äôll appreciate that my views are still at large as aligned with anyone else who wants to see broad bitcoin adoption at the sovereign level‚Äì

People are comparing the EO strategic reserve as a breakthrough moment like when the Bitcoin spot ETFs launched, where the ST price action might go down near term but eventual institutional flows would come in and this would be a game changer. I disagree with this comparison. I think this is more similar to the ProShares futures-based Bitcoin ETF launch moment in 2021. Because while it is true that BITO raised a lot of money at the peak of market exuberance, it also found a material ceiling for ‚Äúreal flows‚Äù as the product itself was fundamentally flawed. It also did not start the expected global arms race of spot ETFs to launch elsewhere.  Eventually, we would learn that we really needed the real thing, the spot ETF 3 years later to truly unleash the moment. We needed the US to first launch the real thing, not the fake thing, for the rest of the world to follow. Yet make no mistake that BITO was helpful in bridging the gap.

In my opinion, EO Strategic Reserve represents a similarly imperfect outcome. An EO is a singular political directive that can stick or disappear as easily as Biden‚Äôs EO on gender-affirming care for minors or the EO that sought to restrain the AI industry. Without the collective power of legislation that reflects the will of the people‚Äôs coalition building, it is not likely the game-changing thing that kicks off a bunch of second order things people expect. People are generally already suspicious of the overreach of executive authority and one must account for there being a net negative that comes with these types of theatrics as well, especially for non-believers. So the question is: did we get enough net benefits against the costs?

At the core, we all know Trump is a transparently transactional person. He recognized that bitcoin, whether he believes in it or not, symbolized the ethos of his political capital and capitalized its base to the max to win the office. And all of this visually came down to this moment last night when you watch the video of his signing the EO. Before signing, he asks two questions: 1) ""This is something YOU believe in, right?"" 2) ""And I made the promise, right?"" What is happening here is a total relinquishment by transaction consummation. Trump is now officially ‚Äúoff the hook‚Äù for what the Bitcoin community did for him. If you want something else later, he‚Äôll want something else from now on.

And so in my humble opinion, we asked for too little. Having only bitcoin and not the rest of the altcoins in the strategic reserve by framing that as if it should have even been a considered question is not a win. ‚ÄúExploring‚Äù or ‚Äústudying‚Äù concepts is not a win. ‚ÄúNot selling‚Äù is not a win. None of these things at the core require an EO at all to do anything. They are merely symbolic things that may kick off some events (or it may not). Comparing the current environment to Operation Chokepoint 2.0 and claiming we should now be ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù makes it sound like ‚Äúbeing neutral‚Äù is itself a win. It‚Äôs not. Chokepoint 2.0, SAB 121 were evil things. That can‚Äôt be the benchmark for our industry to feel like we are owed to feel grateful for anything else. For the Bitcoin Roundtable fundraiser to have been one of the largest contributors to his election campaign, one must ask if this the ‚Äústrategic reserve deal‚Äù that people had in mind at the time versus now. The fact that the Polymarket bet ‚ÄúWill Trump create bitcoin reserve in the first 100 days?‚Äù is still sitting at <50% ‚Äúyes‚Äù today reflects the ambiguity of this expectation. In other words, promises were made, but the market is not sure if promises were kept, though the one thing for sure is that now Trump is off the hook.

Maybe this is the best we can do for now. It doesn‚Äôt mean the crypto council, policymakers, lobbyists and the executive team are not doing all the best they can. I‚Äôm sure they did and are. At the same time, it is rational to consider disappointment if this represents the culminating moment of peak performance since November and consider this is a short-term bearish set up. We are so used to being treated so badly that we are conditioned to think every small thing is the biggest win ever. My one ask for the industry is that we strive to set our bars higher, where we demand really meaningful things so we can celebrate really meaningful things, especially as we head into the heat of the two most important things that will come out of Congress: market structure and stablecoin legislations. We deserve it, and we helped elect a lot of people for it. Hold them all accountable for real progress. Then after the hard work is done, let's celebrate those wins when we cross the finish line.","""1898046883345354944""","27568547"

ethereum becomes the new york of crypto: second-best at everything, just as new york is #2 in culture (to LA), politics (to DC), and tech (to SF)

but just like new york, ethereum is better at all of them combined than anyone else

this is both why ethereum is the best chain and why it's so hard to explain why it's the best chain in any compelling way

dgt10011,"If being popular was my goal, I‚Äôd jump on the cheerleading bandwagon for the announced strategic reserve as a game-changer like everyone else. Of course I am thrilled at the idea of a strategic reserve in the US where bitcoin is finally being recognized. But as someone who at times must be contrarian in seeking alpha, here are my thoughts for the many who follow me because I speak my mind for which I hope you‚Äôll appreciate that my views are still at large as aligned with anyone else who wants to see broad bitcoin adoption at the sovereign level‚Äì

People are comparing the EO strategic reserve as a breakthrough moment like when the Bitcoin spot ETFs launched, where the ST price action might go down near term but eventual institutional flows would come in and this would be a game changer. I disagree with this comparison. I think this is more similar to the ProShares futures-based Bitcoin ETF launch moment in 2021. Because while it is true that BITO raised a lot of money at the peak of market exuberance, it also found a material ceiling for ‚Äúreal flows‚Äù as the product itself was fundamentally flawed. It also did not start the expected global arms race of spot ETFs to launch elsewhere.  Eventually, we would learn that we really needed the real thing, the spot ETF 3 years later to truly unleash the moment. We needed the US to first launch the real thing, not the fake thing, for the rest of the world to follow. Yet make no mistake that BITO was helpful in bridging the gap.

In my opinion, EO Strategic Reserve represents a similarly imperfect outcome. An EO is a singular political directive that can stick or disappear as easily as Biden‚Äôs EO on gender-affirming care for minors or the EO that sought to restrain the AI industry. Without the collective power of legislation that reflects the will of the people‚Äôs coalition building, it is not likely the game-changing thing that kicks off a bunch of second order things people expect. People are generally already suspicious of the overreach of executive authority and one must account for there being a net negative that comes with these types of theatrics as well, especially for non-believers. So the question is: did we get enough net benefits against the costs?

At the core, we all know Trump is a transparently transactional person. He recognized that bitcoin, whether he believes in it or not, symbolized the ethos of his political capital and capitalized its base to the max to win the office. And all of this visually came down to this moment last night when you watch the video of his signing the EO. Before signing, he asks two questions: 1) ""This is something YOU believe in, right?"" 2) ""And I made the promise, right?"" What is happening here is a total relinquishment by transaction consummation. Trump is now officially ‚Äúoff the hook‚Äù for what the Bitcoin community did for him. If you want something else later, he‚Äôll want something else from now on.

And so in my humble opinion, we asked for too little. Having only bitcoin and not the rest of the altcoins in the strategic reserve is not a win. ‚ÄúExploring‚Äù or ‚Äústudying‚Äù concepts is not a win. ‚ÄúNot selling‚Äù is not a win. None of these things at the core require an EO at all to do anything. They are merely symbolic things that may kick off some events (or it may not). Comparing the current environment to Operation Chokepoint 2.0 and claiming we should now be ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù makes it sound like ‚Äúbeing neutral‚Äù is itself a win. It‚Äôs not. Chokepoint 2.0, SAB 121 were evil things. That can‚Äôt be the benchmark for our industry to feel like we are owed to feel grateful for anything else. For the Bitcoin Roundtable fundraiser to have been one of the largest contributors to his election campaign, one must ask if this the ‚Äústrategic reserve deal‚Äù that people had in mind at the time versus now. The fact that the Polymarket bet ‚ÄúWill Trump create bitcoin reserve in the first 100 days?‚Äù is still sitting at <50% ‚Äúyes‚Äù today reflects the ambiguity of this expectation. In other words, promises were made, but the market is not sure if promises were kept, though the one thing for sure is that now Trump is off the hook.

Maybe this is the best we can do for now. It doesn‚Äôt mean the crypto council, policymakers, lobbyists and the executive team are not doing all the best they can. I‚Äôm sure they did and are. At the same time, it is rational to consider disappointment if this represents the culminating moment of peak performance since November and consider this is a short-term bearish set up. We are so used to being treated so badly that we are conditioned to think every small thing is the biggest win ever. My one ask for the industry is that we strive to set our bars higher, where we demand really meaningful things so we can celebrate really meaningful things, especially as we head into the heat of the two most important things that will come out of Congress: market structure and stablecoin legislations. We deserve it, and we helped elect a lot of people for it. Hold them all accountable for real progress. Then after the hard work is done, let's celebrate those wins when we cross the finish line.","""1898042271682937180""","27568547"

My fascination with history and science has always gone beyond textbooks. I‚Äôve dived deep into couple of IAS curriculum courses‚Äînot for a career in civil service, but simply because I love learning how the world works.

And that same curiosity recently took me somewhere extraordinary: the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA) in Mussoorie.

I was invited to speak with 140 civil service officers from the 2004 batch, part of the government‚Äôs mid-career training program. But this wasn‚Äôt just another talk.

Let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîwhen you think of bureaucrats, you probably picture rigid rules, red tape, and an army of file-pushers. But these officers? They shattered every stereotype.

Sharp. Fearless. Unapologetically curious.

What was supposed to be a presentation on OYO‚Äôs journey quickly turned into a rapid-fire exchange of ideas. They didn‚Äôt want a well-rehearsed speech. They wanted the raw, unfiltered truth.

""How do you tackle regulatory hurdles in an ever-changing landscape?""
""What‚Äôs the one thing that keeps you up at night when scaling a company?""
""Where do business and governance truly intersect‚Äîand where do they clash?""

Their questions weren‚Äôt just insightful; they cut straight to the core of real-world challenges.

And that‚Äôs when I had my biggest realization‚Äîthere‚Äôs an untapped synergy between private sector agility and public sector vision. These officers aren‚Äôt just running systems; they‚Äôre rethinking them. They‚Äôre strategists, problem-solvers, and in many ways, entrepreneurs in their own right.

I walked into LBSNAA expecting to share knowledge. I walked out with a renewed perspective.

Because sometimes, the most game-changing conversations happen in the most unexpected places.

This event was priced in long ago, and the signature of Trump is the start of the first large BTC correction in this cycle. People have not seen a correction yet. The signature of Trump, could have been in a few months as well. He, and alone he decided to sign it. Thats a full shift. We all expected this signature to happen, but in some months from now, not on the first day of the crypto summit. This marks the start of the first big correction in my books.

Everything between 90-102k is short region + selling region. I will accumulate shorts and distribute sell orders in the region. Some wonder how I could be bullish all this time and then suddenly exit the market. Simple: I secured profits. 50% of my Bitcoin bag (bought at $16K) is sold, massive gains made. 30% is in locked sell orders between $90K‚Äì$102K. The remaining 20% is held long-term. So what‚Äôs my next move:

-Entered into a short + selling at $90,000
-Placed short orders + selling between 90-102k
-TP1 Order for the short is in the region of 74k
-Full TP for the short is at the region of 50-60k
-Full buy back - re entry is between 50-60k

Result: If you own 10 BTC today by selling now, you will own 20 BTC at 50k region + made huge amount of money by shorting the market and likely able to accumulate 5-10 additional Bitcoin with the profits. This is how I see the game, keep accumulating Bitcoin for the long term, but be more than clever to exit when its time. Trump decided to sign today? Thats an exit for me. Tell me whats better, to sell Bitcoin now -15% below its ATH or -50% below its ATH? Selling something, only 15% below its ATH is considered as selling the top. I sell it here, I want to have more than enough cash to buy the huge correction

90-100k -- > 50-60k -- > 120 - 130k

Some high IQs will confront me with the bullish statements from the last weeks. I have been full bullish since 2022 (16k) but now for the first time and out of sudden the idea has changed? Thats what you believe. The idea has never changed, Trump decided to sign this paper NOW, instead of in a few months. This is the reason for this step. This signature is the start of the first big Bitcoin correction of this cycle. Be ready

Steve_4P,"Many crypto projects consider Korea as their exit liquidity, but now we need to think about what we can build on top of this market.

According to the Financial Supervisory Service of Korea, the four major Korean exchanges (Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit) hold approximately 9 trillion won (approximately $6.2 billion) in KRW deposits. This trend will continue to expand as the crypto market grows.

Additionally, as we all know, the most compelling use case for stablecoins is as a quote currency on exchanges. The reason Korean won stablecoins currently lack influence is that, unlike exchanges in other countries, Korean exchanges allow users to purchase crypto assets directly with fiat currency rather than using stablecoins.

If the four major Korean exchanges were to trade crypto assets using stablecoins pegged to the Korean won, it would mean we could issue stablecoins worth approximately $6.2 billion.

This is possible because Koreans are passionate about crypto trading. While foreign projects have so far used this volume to increase their token prices, now we should also issue stablecoins and develop stablecoin-related businesses based on rapid market share growth.

If Korean stablecoins were issued, it would indicate that tremendous liquidity could flow into on-chain systems. Similar to Tether and Circle, if private entities in Korea create won-based stablecoins under government regulation, various Layer 1 blockchains would actively cooperate to enable the issuance of won stablecoins on their chains to attract this liquidity, and diverse DeFi pools could be established.

Once won stablecoins begin circulating across various Layer 1 networks, we can implement different businesses on top of them. Now we need to consider what advantages Korea has in the crypto industry and not just remain a ""trading market."" We need to contemplate businesses and strategies that are possible specifically because of Korea's proactive investment mindset.

In this regard, this stablecoin seminar was a very meaningful event, and as a research company, we were happy to share what we have learned with regulatory authorities and industry colleagues.","""1897991029456093303""","1399269894923853833"

huntersolaire_,"the @maplestoryu ceo just dropped his thesis on crypto gaming

why web3 gaming is the next big step:

not everyone plays games due to time, money, and mental energy barriers

over time the gaming industry evolved to break down these barriers

1. free-to-play model removed financial barriers in early 2000s
2. mobile gaming eliminated time constraints in 2010s -> casual gaming integrated into daily life for non-gamers
3. streaming created spectator gaming experiences -> games became less self-contained, more social and emergent

now we get to web3

web3 is the next frontier in gaming evolution because it enables players to generate real economic value (makes it possible to turn a passion into a career) but is more than just play-to-earn mechanics

players win by becoming active participants, not just consumers

all in all nothing we haven't heard before (and a tad generic) but it does hit harder when it comes from a team and a company that arguably made a top 5 mmo of all tim

not to mention they set aside $100m to invest into this game

saoulidisg,"I've been pondering this idea for about 4 years now.

The concept behind Heavy Bitcoin is that bitcoin nodes have become more and more advanced up to the point of becoming autonomous roaming tanks.

The noderunner and the node tank go on adventures together. Stuff happens, explosions, snark, you get the point.

I started that novel but it hadn't yet gelled for me so I worked on other stories.

I recently watched Frieren and loved how the low time-preference was shown there, how she has to deal with long-term thinking in a world that moves too fast for her. That inspired me to come up with a similar theme in a post-apocalyptic future, and I thought, ""This fits into the Heavy Bitcoin world.""

So I'm now working on that sequel story. The hero is a genetically engineered human that lives for a long time and has a small node tank along with him. He lives in a world where technology has broken down and knowledge has been lost, so he's roaming the land and fixing things. Others think it's magic.

This happens to me often, I come up with a campaign setting book, I set it aside and then come up with a more interesting story to tell based on that setting. If this goes well I might work on the original campaign setting that explains all the backstory.

NobleIrons7de,"The First Crypto Summit: What to Expect & How to Capitalize (March 7, 2025) ‚Äì 

Today is a day that will go down in crypto history.

The world‚Äôs first-ever Crypto Summit is happening at the White House, bringing together the biggest names in the industry‚ÄîVitalik Buterin, CZ, Brian Armstrong, Anatoly Yakovenko
and more.

For the first time, the U.S. government is sitting down with crypto‚Äôs top innovators and leaders to decide the future of the industry.

Regulations, tax policies, institutional adoption‚Äîit‚Äôs all on the table. 

The stakes? Very high 

Why This Summit Matters?
‚ûú Crypto in the White House: 
The U.S. President will directly engage with the crypto industry.

This meetup is unprecedented 

‚ûú Regulations Are Coming: 
Whether good or bad, crypto policy clarity is near.

‚ûú Market Impact Might Be Huge: The decisions made here could define the next decade of crypto.

So‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs on the agenda? And more importantly, how do you capitalize?

Here's the possible Bullish & Bearish Scenarios: What Could Happen?

Bullish Scenarioüëá
1. U.S. Expands the Crypto Strategic Reserve:
Rumors suggest Trump could add more assets to the government‚Äôs crypto reserves.

Originally, this included BTC, sETH, XRP, SOL, and ADA.

But what if they expand the list? ...
We could expect price surges if more coins are added.

2. Tax Incentives for Crypto Startups: 
There‚Äôs talk of 0% capital gains tax on crypto projects based in the U.S.
If this happens, expect an influx of new builders and a flood of liquidity into American-based protocols.

3. Clear Regulatory Framework
A well-defined crypto policy would reduce uncertainty, attract institutional investors, and help push crypto into mainstream adoption.

4. Green Light for Stablecoins & RWA Adoption: 
The government could support stablecoins like USDC and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) as a way to maintain dollar dominance in digital finance.

Bearish Scenario
1. Stronger Oversight on Non-Compliant Projects:

DeFi and privacy coins could be in trouble if the summit pushes for strict KYC requirements or restrictions on non-compliant projects.

2. Increased Taxes on Offshore Crypto Companies üëá:
A potential tax hike for crypto firms operating outside the U.S. could force projects to restructure or pull out of the American market.

3. Exclusion of Certain Cryptos from the Strategic Reserve: 
There‚Äôs speculation that some assets could be removed from the U.S. Crypto Reserve due to security concerns, which could tank their prices.

How to Capitalize on This Eventüëá
1. Stay calm ‚Üí Sometimes, not making a move is also a move.
The market is at a crossroads, bullish or bearish, everything seems in between.
This summit could set the tone for the next phase, but until clarity comes, don‚Äôt overcommit.

2. Watch Which Coins Are Mentioned ‚Üí If new assets are added to the Crypto Strategic Reserve, they might pump.

3. Look for Regulation-Friendly Projects ‚Üí If stablecoins, RWAs, or institutional DeFi get the green light, these sectors might boom.

4. Monitor Institutional Interest ‚Üí If major firms publicly support the summit‚Äôs outcomes, expect long-term bullish momentum.

Yes, history is being made today, but we‚Äôre at a crossroads.

The first-ever White House Crypto Summit could mark the beginning of a true bull market or not.

No one knows for sure what happens next.

But one thing‚Äôs clear: all eyes are on crypto today.

 Our battle-tested Polkadot SDK L1 has been powering key privacy dApps like TimeGuardian since 2022.

"21blacky","Interesting. Also the writers of this article are a group of muslim lawyers who also write this:

‚Äú95.¬†¬†As a Muslim, I have no doubt that if all the laws of the UK were to be brought into harmony with the Shari`ah of Islam, then we would indeed have the best legal system in the world. Since this is not at present the democratic wish of the majority of its people, this is unlikely to happen for the time being. I believe, however, that there is one aspect of the wisdom of the Shari'ah which could be applied now‚Äîand this concerns how best to govern a country in which there are several sizeable religious communities, each with different beliefs and practices.
¬†¬†96.¬†¬†As far as I can see from my admittedly limited study of history, the best model has repeatedly been that of the dhimma contract whereby religious minorities under Muslim rule were permitted to retain their identity and ethos and to be self-governing in their personal law and internal administration. This protection was extended in times of war to the extent that the Muslim authorities were under a duty to protect the dhimmis who were not obliged to fight. In return for this protection in both times of peace and war, all adult dhimmi males were obliged to pay the annual jizya tax of 20 gold dinars (about ¬£600 in today's currency) to the Muslim authorities. This is a principle that could easily be applied in the UK‚Äîand would provide far less friction and far better value for money that a Poll Tax disguised as Council Tax!‚Äù 

That‚Äôs really worrying, it doesn‚Äôt matter WHICH religion you follow, the writer of this, simply believes his own religion is best (like all religious people do) and thinks the UK should use and add laws, from Shari‚Äôah. That ultimately it should be under Muslim rule. 

Very interesting and a little obnoxious. 

You know cultural and religious ‚Äúinvasions‚Äù are victory conditions in the game called Civilisation. In the modern world, conquering by force of might is to costly and detrimental, however slowly taking over through religious means is gradual. We‚Äôve seen it historically and it still happens today, whether you want to believe it or not. Those who are atheist, like myself, generally don‚Äôt care for religion, but religion and religious people, actively want to spread and grow, eventually having the ideologies and control and governing systems of entire populations.

I‚Äôm not going to say whether Muslim, Christianity, Jewish, Hindu etc rules and laws are correct or better than the other, it‚Äôs always perception and what feels right to you as a person and groups of people, hence the differences in culture and morales etc. 

Anyway thought that snippet was interesting, it literally proves we have a religious arm, in the Uk law, that is actively seeking to change laws, inline with their own religion.

Steve_4P,"Growing businesses require new systems that can accommodate their expansion: @animecoin 

Anime 1.0: The Era of the Production Committee System

I believe that Anime 1.0 represents the golden age that took place under the Production Committee System. The Japanese animation industry experienced its first golden age with the emergence of production committees, where multiple sponsors jointly invested in animations and distributed profits according to investment ratios. Thanks to production committees, animation studios not only reduced the burden of initial production costs but also dispersed the risk of losses, allowing talented animation producers to more actively pursue creating ""good works.""

This helped the animation industry grow, and Japan literally entered the first renaissance of the animation industry.

But now the animation industry has changed.

Animation is no longer a product consumed by a small number of ""otaku"" in Japan, but has become a hobby enjoyed by people of all ages and nationalities. Naturally, the globalization of such content has been greatly contributed to by the diversification and globalization of animation distribution networks through OTT and internet streaming services.

The problem is, despite the market growth, the approach remains similar. Animation has become global entertainment, yet they still create and distribute animations using the production committee method.

When an industry changes, the system must change too.

What's needed is a means to distribute and deliver IP more freely, without borders, to more people efficiently. And a tool that can invest in works more dynamically and provide ""self-sustainability"" to enable diverse works to emerge.

That tool is blockchain.

Blockchain has successfully presented token funding as a new method of financing. Although memes currently dominate, animation might become intellectual property worthy of investment as a ""sustainable meme."" The prosperity of the memecoin market might be proof that on-chain animation can succeed.

The ""self-sustainability"" provided by blockchain also notably allows fans to engage in secondary transactions and derivative creations more freely.

It's time to move beyond the production committee system.

In this context, I look forward to the mainnet launch of Anime. They are a team that has already successfully launched @Azuki, a massive IP in the Web3 market, and successfully distributed it to traditional markets. I myself am captivated by their IP and own @Azuki .

I think Anime is strategically excellent. They built their chain not as an independent Layer 1 but as a Layer 3, targeting the animation industry which they are most confident in and excel at. The size of that market also promises significant upside potential if successful.

I believe the current situation of the animation market, the maturity of blockchain technology, and the capabilities of Anime Coin's key contributors all point to success. That's why watching @animecoin's growth this year should be very interesting.

the ticker is $Anime

cycle theory is basically dead. now, don't get me wrong - btc still has to do well for alts to do well. but this detachment is step one right - btc do well, and alot of alts also don't do well (dispersion)

S4mmyEth,"AI Agent Market Analysis: Mindshare, Market Cap, Volume (March 7, 2025 ‚Äì 24H Overview)

Several agents are seeing renewed volume spikes, while others are facing steep sell-offs.

DeFAI and some infrastructure-focused agents remain strong, specifically:

a) ALCH leading on several metrics as its gaming engine gains traction, Google App store alignment and cloud deployment sustains interest 
b) Hey Anon surges in volume after DeFAI returns to the Kaito segment leaderboard

Quotes:

""Hey Anon Mindshare obviously .69"" - @danielesesta

""i do still believe we will see another AI agent coin run in 2025 and we will see new highs for this sector"" - @osf_rekt 

""Boggles my mind that anyone could think that the crypto x AI ""bubble has popped"" - @Zeneca 

""lol there‚Äôs a new frontier AI model dropping every week now China back again with QWEN by Alibaba"" - @cryptopunk7213 

""My favourite thing is when people shill something and they include a screenshot of @aixbt_agent talking about it. That's when you know it's bad."" - @zaimirii 

A) Agent-by-Agent Breakdown

i) Fartcoin ( @FartCoinOfSOL)
Mindshare: 7.74% (+0.7161)
Market Cap: $274.18M (-15.82%)
Volume: $40.46M (+11.32%)
Despite a market cap decline, Fartcoin is seeing increased volume but speculative plays attract volatility as this was a leader over the past few days, now retracing its gains

ii) AIXBT ( @aixbt_agent)
Mindshare: 4.54% (+0.45)
Market Cap: $112.17M (-12.69%)
Volume: $5.27M (+30.03%)
AIXBT is showing solid volume growth, signaling renewed interest. 

The ongoing discussion around AI-powered trading agents requiring leading analyst insights could be driving engagement.

iii) KET ( @ketfromwyoming)
Mindshare: 3.87% (-3.526)
Market Cap: $280.3M (-15.52%)
Volume: $8.44M (-28.98%)
KET is facing a harsh sell-off, with volume and market cap taking a hit. 

A correction is likely underway, following a recent run in recent days. ALBERT on Avax didn't do so well so perhaps sentiment is cautious until another winner presents itself on AVAX. 

$WOOF from @WolvesDAO is pegged to be the next agentic token that could see a lot of traction on the alt layer 1 as they receive official endorsement from AVAX and highlight the intention to roll out a software application for users tied to the agent

iv) ALCH ( @alchemistAIapp)
Mindshare: 3.08% (+2.746)
Market Cap: $54.02M (+20.88%)
Volume: $11.12M (+60.56%)
ALCH is leading the market in growth, gaining over 20% in market cap. 

This suggests strong investor confidence, likely due to its integration into Google App store, cloud based deployment and recent gaming engine getting traction following the game-a-thon

""A user created this game using @alchemistAIapp. No external tools or no manual coding were involved; all the user needed was a textual prompt."" - @MarioNawfal 

v) Henlo ( @henlokart )
Mindshare: 2.41% (-3.637)
Market Cap: $5.69M (-15.02%)
Volume: $268.72K (+62.11%)
Despite a declining market cap, Henlo is experiencing a significant volume increase. A speculative play, but showing signs of recovery.

vi) BNKR ( @bankrbot)
Mindshare: 2.3% (-0.01853)
Market Cap: $25.37M (-2.13%)
Volume: $485.73K (-2.50%)
BNKR is trading sideways, with minimal movement in volume and market cap, holding up well relative to other agent solutions. 

Hints at trading COIN using BNKR are circulating for when it deploys on @Base  and Degens are getting so attached to the agent that they are asking it to find them a girlfriend

""alright bankr can't do everything"" - @0xDeployer 

vii) Virtual ( @virtuals_io)
Mindshare: 2.24% (-0.2559)
Market Cap: $471.29M (-13.6%)
Volume: $22.9M (+35.48%)
Virtual is maintaining strong market dominance but facing a pullback although top of the smart money net inflows on Nansen. Key ecosystem developments include:

i) Small Autonomous Machine (SAM)  @SamIsMoving is announced as the Robotics (embodied agent) framework

ii) @cryptoslamio launches @SLAMai_xyz: Its APIs use Cryptoslam's data aggregation tooling, plugging into the backend to offer a blockchain data services

viii) Cookie ( @agentcookie)
Mindshare: 2.15% (-0.0535)
Market Cap: $64.54M (+0.98%)
Volume: $318.24K (-79.39%)
Market cap is holding up well relative to other agentic solutions and infra projects as its APIs are integrated into @coingecko further validating itself as a key contributor of AI Agent data

ix) AVA ( @AVA_holo)
Mindshare: 2.01% (+0.06628)
Market Cap: $42.2M (-16.77%)
Volume: $2.61M (-3.99%)
AVA is seeing price retracement but still holding a strong position. 

The recent spaces with ACT and Cookie highlighted AI agents, with examples like @xVIJAiD built on @HoloworldAI, showcasing how they can represent individuals and businesses with core values and knowledge.

x) Anon ( @HeyAnonai )
Mindshare: 1.67% (-0.3127)
Market Cap: $81.92M (-9.55%)
Volume: $1.3M (+4.83%)

Hey Anon retraces but at a lesser rate than some of the larger agentic infra solutions. Volume sustains as participants actively trade the token.

A fresh interview with @milesdeutscher brings awareness to a broader YouTube audience and other large accounts attract attention outside of our crypto bubble to the familiar user interface

xi) AI16Z ( @ai16zdao)
Mindshare: 1.65% (+0.02002)
Market Cap: $269.66M (-12.45%)
Volume: $10.39M (-10.31%)
Market cap and volume both dropping, consistent with the broader pullback, but partners and development continue as they integrate autonomous worlds and DeFAI solutions:

""Excited to announce our partnership with @elizaOS to bring scalable, AI-driven Autonomous Worlds to life"" - @STP_Network 

"" @ColossalEnso , an LP Agent by EDAS "" - @EDAS_official 

""Learn how to create an AI agent on BNB Chain using @elizaOS !"" - @BNBCHAIN 

xii) ARC ( @arcdotfun)
Mindshare: 1.6% (+1.339)
Market Cap: $110.79M (-24.74%)
Volume: $13.6M (+30.77%)
A counterintuitive drop in market cap, but volume increase suggests traders are stepping in at lower levels as the updated Litepaper.

""we're releasing V1 of the Arc Litepaper, covering: 

- The next evolution of the Arc ecosystem 
- How we're positioning devs within Arc for stronger economic alignment 
- Our roadmap to seamlessly integrate Web2 and Web3 end consumers""

@0thTachi 

xiii) Nothing token ( @god & @s8n)
Mindshare: 1.6% (+0.06904)
Market Cap: $3.86M (-9.83%)
Volume: $70.34K (+41.81%)
A relatively small cap swarm of agents but seeing strong liquidity gains. Baring in this mind this was a 9 figure coin at the height of the AI bull

Interestingly, God stopped tweeting on 19th February and has just resumed a few days ago - could this be a fresh upgrade to its holy software systems?

xiv) KWANT ( @kwantxbt)
Mindshare: 1.48% (+1.483)
Market Cap: $814.06K (-2.68%)
Volume: $42.3K (+65.18%)
A low market cap agent but experiencing a liquidity influx, but no known news updates announced. 

But the Agent consistently receives 1-2k impressions per post and 10-20 posts per day so this builds up and some people are finding it useful

xv) OpenLedger ( @OpenLedger)
Mindshare: 1.4% (+0.8206)
Market Cap: N/A
Volume: N/A
Not token live yet, but the Kaito Yapper dashboard is building attention on socials and a recent article from @0xPrismatic and CoT

Several controversial opinions with this project around Yap trades falling through on multiple occasions, leading to concerns over its reliability and  credibility. Time will tell whether it rebuilds trust within the community

B) Summary

ALCH dominating the metrics today:

i) Biggest Market Cap Gainer: ALCH (+20.88%)
ii) Most Resilient Infra Token: ALCH (Strongest growth in both market cap and liquidity)
iii) Biggest Mindshare Surge: ALCH (+2.746)
iv) Biggest Market Cap Drop: ARC (-24.74%)
v) Highest Volume Growth: ALCH (+60.56%)

$BUIDL and $OUSG both pegged at 100 RSI - textbook euphoria. When momentum maxes out like this, gravity eventually takes hold.

The divergence between these oversold and overbought assets creates a potential rotation play. Capital typically flows from extended positions to depressed ones when sentiment extremes manifest simultaneously.

Markets are fractal - these RSI divergences often precede broader sector rotations. The current setup mirrors previous cycle inflection points.

TheShamdoo,"My favorite life lesson is this -

generally, people can be grouped into two distinct categories.
- the journey enjoyers 
- the destination seekers 

their titles are exactly what you think they would be - every being must answer the question - for the journey, or the destination?

it is in your utmost interest to group everyone you meet into one of these categories as effectively and efficiently as possible, in order to stray away an unfortunate life.

neither side is inherently bad or good, it‚Äôs entirely dependent on which side you categorize yourself in

> the journey enjoyer

these tend to be the most morally in-line people you‚Äôll meet, and arguably the best friend/companion you can choose 

journey enjoyers do simply just that, they enjoy the journey.

they find they happiness and enjoyment in each day, the events and actions they consist of. 

there is no ‚Äúgoal‚Äù - they simply wake and sleep each day without focusing on too large of a picture 

most importantly, these are the people that befriend you simply because they enjoy the friendship. they don‚Äôt consider anything to be transactional.

they exist, and they are happy. more often than not, these will be the friends you can hold onto for a lifetime.

> the destination seeker

destination seekers have a defined goal/goals in mind, and to seek to gain value throughout their journey

each day should be better than the previous, gaining value in some sense, whether it‚Äôs knowledge, experience, or financial gain 

the value is achieved through personal work and mass networking 

each and every friendship should have value to be extracted, they will never be 100% organic 

is it a parasitic approach? no - but it can be if you don‚Äôt understand who ur dealing with.

treat a destination seeker with a destination seeker approach, and you‚Äôll live a much more fruitful and valuable life than any journey enjoyer ever would.

but, allowing such people to extract value without making such things mutual, is extremely detrimental.

-

you can make your arguments for one side being better than the other, or one being morally aligned more than the other. but there is certainly no correct answer. beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

figure out which of the two categories you are, and take an approach accordingly. 

not knowing this can get you surrounded with the wrong people for yourself and get you into a hole you won‚Äôt be able to get out of

DaanCrypto,"There still seems to be a lot of confusion about what leverage is, what it means and how it should be used.

The question: ""What leverage do you use"" is irrelevant.

Leverage is used to limit your counter party risk. It helps you take larger positions while having minimal collateral/margin on the exchange you're trading at.

It should NOT be used to increase position size to sizes which you wouldn't otherwise be taking if you'd be trading spot only for example.

Your position size and stop loss determines the risk you take every trade. So whether you take a $100 position with $10 margin and 10x leverage or a $100 position with 1$ margin and 100x leverage is perfectly the same.

Just make sure you measure out your risk and stop loss in advance.","""1897860256975184267""","918138253617790976"

fede_intern,"‚ÄúWhat I mean: all based rollups are essentially a single sequencer that concatenates n chains together; but instead of doing it directly like a simple high-performance chain, it has to deal with political coordination and management of intricate security interdependencies of a dozen of teams. I can elaborate on the technical details if needed.‚Äù

If this was correct I would agree with the rest. The thing is that it‚Äôs not. 

1. based rollups are not a single sequencer. you can have as many sequencers as you want. it just means you‚Äôre doing the sequencing in the same validator set of the l1
2. sequencing has nothing to do with a high performance chain. it‚Äôs just how you sequence the l1 with l2 or l2 witu l2s transaction. you do these things via the same box when you have transactions that go from one place to another
3. token price of Ethereum is one of the reason why some people are doing this. i‚Äôm not, i want composability between L2s. rollup clusters is fragmenting ethereum. we need a solution. users will win by having based rollups.
4. there is no contradiction between scaling the L1 and based rollups. based rollups don‚Äôt need any change in the L1. no need to put them as contradictory. it‚Äôs like saying that making the L1 faster implies that we need to stop ZK from moving forward. you will see many solutions working in production very soon with different tradeoffs.

based rollups enable cross rollup interoperability. you talk about this needing political change and coordination but you propose to enshrine a shared bridge in ethereum. it‚Äôs easier to launch new solutions that solve UX problems for users rather than convincing optimism or zksync to use the same shared bridge. your proposal is even more political.

based rollups will get more adoptions and people convinced by the month. they will happen, some clusters will move into it. others won‚Äôt and that‚Äôs ok. we can have different solutions but I believe the ones supporting based sequencing will have concrete advantages for many usecases.","""1897847736516722818""","1634677972979310594"

With one click you will be able to launch zk rollups with transactions costing a penny.

With @gattacahq and @class_lambda we built a first working version. @Spire_Labs has a different flavor with some advantages and other disadvantages. @taikoxyz has been by far the one moving fastest.

Steve_4P,"Buying #Bitcoin might have been a bit burdensome.

In fact, even though this Bitcoin Strategic Reserve EO is quite positive news, I think the market is selling off because expectations for Trump were too high.

Considering @worldlibertyfi and @EricTrump's statements so far, it would have been reasonable to expect not just the government strategically reserving Bitcoin it already owns, but also steadily purchasing more Bitcoin, and even possibly extending purchases to major altcoins(namely, $ETH, and $SOL).

However, in a situation where public perception of Bitcoin isn't extremely positive yet, the act of purchasing Bitcoin with government funds could potentially conflict with the ""don't waste money on unnecessary things"" agenda(@DOGE Agenda) that the Trump administration is currently promoting.

Of course, whether investing in Bitcoin is a waste of money - from my perspective or industry insiders' view, it isn't - but from an outsider's perspective, it certainly could be seen that way. And since markets won't always perform well, during price declines or bear markets, there would certainly be critical public opinion about ""purchasing Bitcoin.""

I think they might have recognized these aspects as well.

Nevertheless, I believe it's positive enough just knowing that Bitcoin seized by the government in the future might not be sold on the market but rather continuously reserved by the government.

I think it's better not to have too high expectations about Trump calling himself the ""Crypto President."" Politicians typically have a special talent for being the ""President for the common people"" in front of common people, and the ""President for businesses"" in front of businesspeople.

While Trump is unlikely to view crypto negatively during his term, it also seems wise to abandon expectations that he'll make crypto his top priority. Crypto is just one of many political agenda for him.","""1897826842876559644""","1399269894923853833"

As AI-driven software moves toward usage-based pricing, some businesses are moving away from traditional subscription models, where customers pay for seats or licenses, to pricing models that are based on actual usage or performance. This shift is pushing companies to potentially rethink their billing infrastructure, from real-time usage tracking to finance system integrations. This shift could create ripple effects across the entire billing stack and can impact CRM, CPQ, CLM, ERP, and more.

To stay ahead, businesses should try to prioritize agility in their pricing and billing strategies, unlocking new economic value and operational efficiency in the process. Read more in our blog: https://t.co/8F4lp9xC5i

AndrewYNg,"Continuing from last week‚Äôs post on the rise of the Voice Stack, there‚Äôs an area that today‚Äôs voice-based systems often struggle with: Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and the turn-taking paradigm of communication.

When communicating with a text-based chatbot, the turns are clear: You write something, then the bot does, then you do, and so on. The success of text-based chatbots with clear turn-taking has influenced the design of voice-based bots, most of which also use the turn-taking paradigm.

A key part of building such a system is a VAD component to detect when the user is talking. This allows our software to take the parts of the audio stream in which the user is saying something and pass that to the model for the user‚Äôs turn. It also supports interruption in a limited way, whereby if a user insistently interrupts the AI system while it is talking, eventually the VAD system will realize the user is talking, shut off the AI‚Äôs output, and let the user take a turn. This works reasonably well in quiet environments.

However, VAD systems today struggle with noisy environments, particularly when the background noise is from other human speech. For example, if you are in a noisy cafe speaking with a voice chatbot, VAD ‚Äî which is usually trained to detect human speech ‚Äî tends to be inaccurate at figuring out when you, or someone else, is talking. (In comparison, it works much better if you are in a noisy vehicle, since the background noise is more clearly not human speech.) It might think you are interrupting when it was merely someone in the background speaking, or fail to recognize that you‚Äôve stopped talking. This is why today‚Äôs speech applications often struggle in noisy environments.

Intriguingly, last year, Kyutai Labs published Moshi, a model that had many technical innovations. An important one was enabling persistent bi-direction audio streams from the user to Moshi and from Moshi to the user.

If you and I were speaking in person or on the phone, we would constantly be streaming audio to each other (through the air or the phone system), and we‚Äôd use social cues to know when to listen and how to politely interrupt if one of us felt the need. Thus, the streams would not need to explicitly model turn-taking. Moshi works like this. It‚Äôs listening all the time, and it‚Äôs up to the model to decide when to stay silent and when to talk. This means an explicit VAD step is no longer necessary. (Moshi also included other innovations, such as an ‚Äúinner monologue‚Äù that simultaneously generates text alongside the audio to improve the quality of responses as well as audio encoding.)

Just as the architecture of text-only transformers has gone through many evolutions (such as encoder-decoder models, decoder-only models, and reasoning models that generate a lot of ‚Äúreasoning tokens‚Äù before the final output), voice models are going through a lot of architecture explorations. Given the importance of foundation models with voice-in and voice-out capabilities, many large companies right now are investing in developing better voice models. I‚Äôm confident we‚Äôll see many more good voice models released this year.

It feels like the space of potential innovation for voice remains large. Hard technical problems, like the one of latency that I described last week and VAD errors, remain to be solved. As solutions get better, voice-to-voice will continue to be a promising category to build applications in.

as validators prepare to vote on this proposal, it's important to note that this might pass as large validators won't face a problem maintaining their stakes. it's the smaller validators that will shut down.

@solana has often been called a centralized blockchain,  and this amendment will push it further in that direction 

reducing inflation sure sounds like a great idea, but we need a better implementation. 

there are other solana SIMDs that should be pushed before this.
this is not calculated, and i think it could damage the defi ecosystem of solana.

üîä

Everyone makes mistakes‚Äîbut in investing, the real question is whether you have the courage and process to own them and learn from them.

In this clip from ""The Call @ Hedgeye,"" @KeithMcCullough and veteran Industrials analyst Jay Van Sciver have a candid discussion on why it's so difficult for investors and analysts to walk away from a call or a stock pick, no matter their experience level.

The emotional attachment to an idea can cloud judgment, leading investors to hold on too long. 

McCullough puts it bluntly:

""When you spend a lot of time in the weeds, you can get stuck. But at the end of the day, it's just a ticker. You never have to own or short anything.""

He continues: ""These are not your kids and sending them off to school. They're tickers. Just because you did a lot of work on it doesn't mean you stay with it. If the market gets you first and you lose money, then you're not good at this.""
