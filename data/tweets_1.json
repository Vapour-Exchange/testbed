    "tweet_content": "We recreated Polymarket on Scroll in under three weeks... all because we fucked up.\n\nThe real story? We started with a dream of building a lending protocol for Polymarket—an idea I was shocked no one had tackled before, given the data. The math was obvious: traders NEED to lock up massive capital in prediction markets and hold positions until market close. That capital sits there, unutilized. Inefficient. Wasteful. For months.\n\nBut when we entered Scroll Open, we hit our first wall: we'd need to build on Scroll. Impossible to directly interface with Polymarket. So what did we do? We pivot. Hard.\n\nWe started with an idea, a prediction market. But not just any market—we wanted something new. A platform where financial participation drives real world outcomes. Think futarchy + prediction markets. We spent weeks on figuring out the system, ensuring there was no way to exploit it. It had the potential to deliver huge impact and it was something close to our hearts, it was transformative.\n\nThen came the questions that every founder dreads: \"How will you get users?\" \"Targeting regen & social impact seriously limits your TAM.\" \"You won't scale.\" I wanted to ignore them. I tried to ignore them. But when the same feedback keeps hitting you from every direction, you have to listen.\n\nSo I looked at @Scroll_ZKP itself—objectively, brutally. The chain had hemorrhaged from $1B TVL down to $80M. 24h DEX volume? A mere $1M with only 5,000 active wallets in the past day. These weren't just numbers. This was a reality check. We went back to users and asked what they actually wanted in a prediction market. The answer was clear: rewards and unlocked liquidity.\n\nThat's when everything clicked. We'd build Polymarket on Scroll, but with our original innovation intact: integrated lending and borrowing. The first of its kind. A prediction market where your positions don’t just sit there, they work for you.\n\nWith just two developers—the same powerhouse builders who've brought countless products to life for our clients at @elvtd_io, we compressed what should have been months of work into mere weeks. We skipped building a CLOB because time was tight. But my team is beyond cracked. Huge shoutout to @cheekychain who created designs that are literally turning heads. We built. We tested. We iterated. We delivered.\n\nAnd here's the most important thing I learned: We're not here just to win a hackathon. We're not building for 6 weeks. We're building for 6 months. For years. For the future. Because the true test of an entrepreneur isn't sticking stubbornly to your original vision—it's having the courage to adapt when reality demands it. It's about building something that will last. That will scale. That will actually work.\n\nSo yes, we pivoted from our heart project. But in finding what the market actually needed, we discovered something even more powerful: a path to sustainable impact.\n\nPrediction markets with $30M daily volume + integrated lending? That's not just a hackathon project. That's a protocol with staying power.\n\nImmensely proud of what we've accomplished. Wildly excited for what's next. This isn't the end. It's barely the beginning. Don’t fade @foresightnow.\n\nThank you to @razacodes @_emjlin @sandyzkp @natonchain @rh_bdl @defidennis for the constant feedbacks & support 🫶 And my incredible devs @MadunProt0col @mengoo6988 who pushed through challenges most would have crumbled under 🔥",

I’ve dived deep into couple of IAS curriculum courses—not for a career in civil service, but simply because I love learning how the world works.\n\nAnd that same curiosity recently took me somewhere extraordinary: the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA) in Mussoorie.\n\nI was invited to speak with 140 civil service officers from the 2004 batch, part of the government’s mid-career training program. But this wasn’t just another talk.\n\nLet’s be honest—when you think of bureaucrats, you probably picture rigid rules, red tape, and an army of file-pushers. But these officers? They shattered every stereotype.\n\nSharp. Fearless. Unapologetically curious.\n\nWhat was supposed to be a presentation on OYO’s journey quickly turned into a rapid-fire exchange of ideas. They didn’t want a well-rehearsed speech. They wanted the raw, unfiltered truth.\n\n\"How do you tackle regulatory hurdles in an ever-changing landscape?\"\n\"What’s the one thing that keeps you up at night when scaling a company?\"\n\"Where do business and governance truly intersect—and where do they clash?\"\n\nTheir questions weren’t just insightful; they cut straight to the core of real-world challenges.\n\nAnd that’s when I had my biggest realization—there’s an untapped synergy between private sector agility and public sector vision. These officers aren’t just running systems; they’re rethinking them. They’re strategists, problem-solvers, and in many ways, entrepreneurs in their own right.\n\nI walked into LBSNAA expecting to share knowledge. I walked out with a renewed perspective.\n\nBecause sometimes, the most game-changing conversations happen in the most unexpected places.\n@LBSNAA_Official #IAS",
