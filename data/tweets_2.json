Alt VMs actually can have an advantage if they can do things EVM ones can’t.\n\nWith one click you will be able to launch zk rollups with transactions costing a penny. \n\nIn a few months to a year with based sequencing you will have composability between different clusters. With @gattacahq and @class_lambda we built a first working version. @Spire_Labs has a different flavor with some advantages and other disadvantages. @taikoxyz has been by far the one moving fastest. Many other teams are pushing for this to become a reality too. We have different visions but we’re all pushing for interoperability between the L2s.\n\nZK proving became a reality fast enough.
