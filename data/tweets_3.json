We now know they were fake. Remember the ‚Äúventilator shortages‚Äù?  Remember the hospital ships coming to relieve the ‚Äúfull‚Äù hospitals?  Remember the concerns of morgues overflowing?   All of it was a sham.   \n\nThe academics, the scientists, the NGOs, the politicians, the medical community - they were all wrong.  All wrong.  They censored and arrested those who stood against the tyranny as they violated human rights.   They were wrong both about the risk ‚Äî Covid was not nearly as deadly as they claimed, and they were wrong about the measures to deal with it.  No matter how deadly, it‚Äôs never legitimate for government to interfere with freedoms in this way. \n\nNow we should all look back and remember the tyranny and ask why this happened.  Most importantly we must make sure it never happens again.  No matter how deadly a virus the government does not have the right to override the risk preferences of an individual.   They‚Äôve tried to bring back the tyranny with ‚ÄúOmicron‚Äù and other efforts and the next pandemic of tyranny may be driven by something else entirely.  But now is the time we can all decide that this will never happen again.  We will not comply.",
