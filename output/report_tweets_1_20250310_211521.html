          <td class="tweet">We recreated Polymarket on Scroll in under three weeks... all because we fucked up.

The real story? We started with a dream of building a lending protocol for Polymarket‚Äîan idea I was shocked no one had tackled before, given the data. The math was obvious: traders NEED to lock up massive capital in prediction markets and hold positions until market close. That capital sits there, unutilized. Inefficient. Wasteful. For months.

But when we entered Scroll Open, we hit our first wall: we'd need to build on Scroll. Impossible to directly interface with Polymarket. So what did we do? We pivot. Hard.

We started with an idea, a prediction market. But not just any market‚Äîwe wanted something new. A platform where financial participation drives real world outcomes. Think futarchy + prediction markets. We spent weeks on figuring out the system, ensuring there was no way to exploit it. It had the potential to deliver huge impact and it was something close to our hearts, it was transformative.

Then came the questions that every founder dreads: "How will you get users?" "Targeting regen & social impact seriously limits your TAM." "You won't scale." I wanted to ignore them. I tried to ignore them. But when the same feedback keeps hitting you from every direction, you have to listen.

So I looked at @Scroll_ZKP itself‚Äîobjectively, brutally. The chain had hemorrhaged from $1B TVL down to $80M. 24h DEX volume? A mere $1M with only 5,000 active wallets in the past day. These weren't just numbers. This was a reality check. We went back to users and asked what they actually wanted in a prediction market. The answer was clear: rewards and unlocked liquidity.

That's when everything clicked. We'd build Polymarket on Scroll, but with our original innovation intact: integrated lending and borrowing. The first of its kind. A prediction market where your positions don‚Äôt just sit there, they work for you.

With just two developers‚Äîthe same powerhouse builders who've brought countless products to life for our clients at @elvtd_io, we compressed what should have been months of work into mere weeks. We skipped building a CLOB because time was tight. But my team is beyond cracked. Huge shoutout to @cheekychain who created designs that are literally turning heads. We built. We tested. We iterated. We delivered.

And here's the most important thing I learned: We're not here just to win a hackathon. We're not building for 6 weeks. We're building for 6 months. For years. For the future. Because the true test of an entrepreneur isn't sticking stubbornly to your original vision‚Äîit's having the courage to adapt when reality demands it. It's about building something that will last. That will scale. That will actually work.

So yes, we pivoted from our heart project. But in finding what the market actually needed, we discovered something even more powerful: a path to sustainable impact.

Prediction markets with $30M daily volume + integrated lending? That's not just a hackathon project. That's a protocol with staying power.

Immensely proud of what we've accomplished. Wildly excited for what's next. This isn't the end. It's barely the beginning. Don‚Äôt fade @foresightnow.

We started with a dream of building a lending protocol for Polymarket\u2014an idea I was shocked no one had tackled before, given the data. The math was obvious: traders NEED to lock up massive capital in prediction markets and hold positions until market close. That capital sits there, unutilized. Inefficient. Wasteful. For months.\n\nBut when we entered Scroll Open, we hit our first wall: we'd need to build on Scroll. Impossible to directly interface with Polymarket. So what did we do? We pivot. Hard.\n\nWe started with an idea, a prediction market. But not just any market\u2014we wanted something new. A platform where financial participation drives real world outcomes.

          <td class="tweet">When an Entrepreneur Meets Nation Builders

My fascination with history and science has always gone beyond textbooks. I‚Äôve dived deep into couple of IAS curriculum courses‚Äînot for a career in civil service, but simply because I love learning how the world works.

And that same curiosity recently took me somewhere extraordinary: the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA) in Mussoorie.

I was invited to speak with 140 civil service officers from the 2004 batch, part of the government‚Äôs mid-career training program. But this wasn‚Äôt just another talk.

Let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîwhen you think of bureaucrats, you probably picture rigid rules, red tape, and an army of file-pushers. But these officers? They shattered every stereotype.

Sharp. Fearless. Unapologetically curious.

What was supposed to be a presentation on OYO‚Äôs journey quickly turned into a rapid-fire exchange of ideas. They didn‚Äôt want a well-rehearsed speech. They wanted the raw, unfiltered truth.

"How do you tackle regulatory hurdles in an ever-changing landscape?"
"What‚Äôs the one thing that keeps you up at night when scaling a company?"
"Where do business and governance truly intersect‚Äîand where do they clash?"

Their questions weren‚Äôt just insightful; they cut straight to the core of real-world challenges.

And that‚Äôs when I had my biggest realization‚Äîthere‚Äôs an untapped synergy between private sector agility and public sector vision. These officers aren‚Äôt just running systems; they‚Äôre rethinking them. They‚Äôre strategists, problem-solvers, and in many ways, entrepreneurs in their own right.

I walked into LBSNAA expecting to share knowledge. I walked out with a renewed perspective.

Because sometimes, the most game-changing conversations happen in the most unexpected places.
