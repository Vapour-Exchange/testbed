Tweet by @tldrnewsletter (similarity score: 0.2422): \"Apple AI turmoil \ud83d\udcf1, China's viral AI agent \ud83e\udd16, Meta's ex-employee blacklist \ud83d\udcbc\n\nTLDR 2025-03-10\n\n\ud83d\udcf1Big Tech & Startups\n\nManus, a New AI Agent From China is Going Viral\u2014And Raising Big Questions \nManus is an autonomous agent that can analyze, plan, and execute tasks on its own. It is currently only accessible through invitation codes, which are in short supply - demand is through the roof as the AI community is raving about its capabilities. Many are now asking whether China has leapfrogged the US in AI. Manus likely achieved its impressive capabilities through innovative fine-tuning rather than core model innovation. A video introducing Manus is available in the article.\n\nApple Delays Siri Upgrade Indefinitely as AI Concerns Escalate \nApple is delaying updates to Siri for the foreseeable future. The company's engineers believe that the features introduced last June won't be released until next year at the earliest. Several executives have voiced strong concerns as the features didn't work as advertised in their personal testing. Apple may have to rebuild the features from scratch.\n\n\ud83d\ude80Science & Futuristic Technology\n\nNatural alternative to Ozempic brings results without side effects \nStanford scientists have identified a naturally occurring molecule that works like semaglutide, producing weight loss and improved glucose and insulin tolerance, when tested in mice and minipigs. The peptide, named BRP, only works in the brain, as opposed to semaglutide, which has widespread effects. It specifically acts in the hypothalamus, which controls appetite and metabolism, which could be an improvement over semaglutide. The scientists intend to move to human clinical trials for BRP.\n\nStarship Flight 8: SpaceX nails Super Heavy booster catch but loses upper stage \nSpaceX's eight Starship test flight last Thursday aimed for the third successful booster recovery and the deployment of a satellite simulator. While the Super Heavy booster returned successfully to Starbase's launch tower, the mission's upper stage disintegrated during its flight. SpaceX has been reviewing the data from the flight to better understand the incident's root cause. Video of the explosion is available in the article.\n\n\ud83d\udcbbProgramming, Design & Data Science\n\nBuilding an Agentic System (Website)\nThis site provides a practical deep dive and code review into how to build a self-driving coding agent, execution engine, tools, and commands. It focuses on the systems and design decisions that go into making agents that are real-time, self-corrective, and useful for productive work. The site provides documentation on every tool and command it covers, as well as implementation details. It covers the underlying patterns that make real-time AI coding assistants feel responsive, safe, and genuinely useful.\n\npg_mooncake \ud83e\udd6e (GitHub Repo)\npg_mooncake is a Postgres extension that adds columnar storage and vectorized execution for fast analytics. It ranks among the top 10 fastest on ClickBench. pg_mooncake supports loading data from Postgres heap tables, Parquet, CSV, and JSON files, Iceberg and Delta Lake tables, and Hugging Face datasets.\n\n\ud83c\udf81Miscellaneous\n\nMicrosoft's Relationship With OpenAI Is Not Looking Good\nMore evidence has surfaced that Microsoft is looking to split with OpenAI. Microsoft is developing its own in-house reasoning models and has been testing models from xAI, Meta, and DeepSeek to replace ChatGPT in Copilot. Copilot has so far been received poorly in enterprise due to its high cost and limited results. OpenAI and Microsoft are quickly becoming competitors, so it makes sense that the companies would want to detach from each other. Microsoft has an interest in controlling the technologies and writing its own destiny.\n\nMeta Takes Another Hit After Reports That It Blacklists Ex-Employees \nMeta reportedly maintains a de facto blacklist of ex-employees - even some former workers with sterling track records have been blocked. The company uses multiple systems to track rehire ineligibility, but the exact mechanisms and number of affected employees are unclear. While the blacklist may not sit well with outsiders, it is not illegal. The routine banishment of ex-workers isn't exclusive to Meta, with Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and many other companies purportedly maintaining similar lists.\n\n\u26a1Quick Links\n\nAI and the Uncertain Future of Work \nAI advancements may unlock powerful new tools for thought and enhance human cognition, resulting in technology that works with us and for us, preempts our requests and understands us, and gets out of our way.\n\nWhy VCs ghost founders, or reject deals and never speak to the founder again \nVCs might ghost founders because of a lack of time, red flags from the founder, and other founder behaviors.\n\nWhat I Learned Building a Free Semantic Search Tool for GitHub and Why I Failed\nUser traction is king - it doesn't matter if your product has promising technical results, if your problem is simply too marginal, then you won't get enough users for a viable product.\n\nElon Musk's AI company, xAI, acquires 1 million-square-foot property in Memphis \nxAI plans to use its newly acquired land to expand its AI data center footprint, hosting infrastructure to complement xAI's existing Memphis data center.\n\nApple Intelligence vision via AirPods camera is in active development \nApple is actively developing a product that combines AirPods with cameras - the cameras will provide data on wearers' surrounding environments to be used in AI features.\n\nSo how well is Claude playing Pok\u00e9mon? \nWhile Claude is pretty good at short term reasoning, which is great for Pok\u00e9mon battles, it's bad at executive function and has a poor memory, which means it is getting stuck in loops.\n\nIf you enjoyed this post...\n\n1) Follow @tldrnewsletter for more daily updates\n\n2) Subscribe to our free email newsletter using the link in our bio.\"\n5.

THE SETUP
• $jup spiraling down to $0.51, bleeding 74% from ath
• @jupiterexchange team wants 4% supply over 4 years while token keeps dropping
• platform's still processing $5b+ volume but trust is gone
• price broke through $0.71, heading to $0.43 unless something changes

THE DRAMA UNFOLDS
• jan 26: promised token buybacks but nothing happened
• feb 17: finally started buying back tokens, way too late
• feb 18: co-founder ben chow steps down after $libra memecoin mess
• mar 6: launched "jupiter 2030" governance vote
• mar 9: compensation drama hits while token makes new lows at $0.55

THE POWER PLAY
• ceo @weremeow wants to lock 280m $jup until 2030
• offering 220m bonus tokens in return
• hired fenwick & west for damage control audit
• launching independent investigation into the $libra situation
• community's split on whether to trust the team anymore

LOOKING AHEAD
• $700m revenue still flowing
• 50% fee buybacks finally starting
• jupnet expansion could change the game
• investigation results will make or break sentiment
• token lockup vote becomes defining moment</td>

This is a very big deal. \n\n2.  Allowing Banks to participate will greatly increase institutional adoption.  \nThis might be more important than the reserve.  \n\n3. Hearing the Sec Treas talk about the importance of $USD stablecoins in keeping the dollar the world\u2019s reserve currency tells me that we have a team that gets it.  Very Bullish stables. \n\n4 why has price of crypto been heavy in 2025.   To start we had a frenzy in Q4 that peaked into inauguration with a Crypto Ball.   Lots got priced in.  All these changes being made take time to implement and institutions move methodically.  Chinese crypto players have a white hot stock market to invest in. $BABA is outperforming any crypto by a lot this year.   We haven\u2019t gotten a new \u2018killer app\u2019 on Web3 that\u2019s taken hold to drive narrative on L1\u2019s like $ETH and $sol. \nMeme coin frenzy crashed with $Trump coin. US stocks which were priced for perfection being sold as people rotate out of America  exceptionalism into China and Europe.   \n\n5.  What\u2019s next . $BTC needs to retake 91k to regain momentum buyers.  Until then we are 75-90 range on charts.  \nRest of Crypto needs a retail Calvary.   What i do know is every time you think they are gone they come back.   Need to see that to get market turned around.  $ETH should hold 2k and needs to hold 2k.    \n\nMedium and long  term this is very bullish. Shorter term a lot of counter balancing forces.  \n\nGood luck out there\"\n5. Tweet by @wassielawyer (similarity score: 0.3681): \"Unsolicited late night thoughts on how to fix the crypto venture financing / altcoin space.\n\n1. Make '% of Company Reserve' meta again. \n\nIn 2022, it was a lot more common to see private investors invest into projects and receive a % of Company Reserve v.s. % of FDV. This means when I invest 1m at 100m, I don't get 1% of total FDV. I get 1% of whatever the team supply is (so if its 20%, I get 0.2%). \n\nThis creates a situation where investor and team are more aligned and far less tokens are being emitted.\n\nThis has fallen off a lot more recently although I still rarely see them with good projects and strong founders.\n\nSure, this means you will raise less money at lower vals which leads me to my next point.\n\n2. Raise less, at lower valuations\n\nLets get real here. 90% of projects don't need 10m+ dollars pre-PMF to build a dApp or a chain. We all know half of you fork code and/or outsource most of your shit to Eastern Europe / SEA / LatAm anyway.\n\nRaising at lower vals means you don't get pressure to launch at retarded vals where the only buyer is the MM you pay (using the 5m dollars you have left after exorbitant salaries and parties). \n\n3. Make the fair launch actually fair\n\nIf you are going to do a 'fair launch' make it actually fair. That means allowing everyone to participate on clearly defined parameters that are not based on who you know or how early you are.\n\nFair launch + getting an MM to snipe your own launch is retarded. Echo rounds where access is gated is retarded. Nobody wants to be someone else's exit liquidity because he knew a guy or got in early. \n\n4. Time based unlock for team makes zero sense\n\nWhy is the team's economics tied to an arbitrary period of time? Shouldn't it be correlated to... actually making the product work?\n\nThis disincentivizes all the market-making nonsense where a team basically just tries to manage token price until the unlocks happen.\n\n5. The token is not the product\n\nFounders need to build something actually useful that people want to use instead of simply paying KOLs to shill the token, TVL providers / liquid funds to counterfeit retail activity and market makers to play the same ponzi game that everyone is playing.\n\n 6. Exchanges should moderate\n\nI'm surprised that exchanges have generally participated in a race to the bottom by competing for listings rather than actually creating strict listing rules and sanctioning projects that do not abide.\n\nActually I'm not surprised because they get fat listing fees + the ponzi projects have the most volume thanks to a literal army of market makers.\n\nI am Wassie in suit ranting.

Clocked in about six hours so far, and I\u2019m in complete awe\u2014this tech is incredible. Can\u2019t even imagine how programmers must feel using this daily to execute complex designs.\n\nThere\u2019s truly nothing you can\u2019t do in today\u2019s world. If you don\u2019t have what you want or find yourself complaining about where you are in life, it\u2019s because you don\u2019t want it bad enough. It\u2019s all out there for the taking.\n\nWhat a time to be alive.\"\n4. Tweet by @Zeneca (similarity score: 0.2374): \"I round tripped 8 figures last cycle. A few things I learned:\n\n- It\u2019s almost always better to sell too early and miss out on gains, then to hold too long and round trip the bag. This is because eventually, almost everything trends to zero, so even your \u201cearly sell\u201d is likely going to make you look like a genius in a few months/years\n\n- If you ever take a PnL screenshot of how much you\u2019re up, sell. You don\u2019t have to sell your entire position, but it\u2019s usually an excellent time to at least trim 20-50% of it.\n\n- Most people on this app have absolutely no idea what they\u2019re talking about. Often the loudest and most confident voices know the least, while the quiet and self questioning ones are full of wisdom.\n\n- You can\u2019t borrow conviction. If you buy something because someone else did or told you it was \u201ca hidden gem\u201d, you\u2019re almost guaranteed to fumble the bag. They\u2019ll dump on your head while you\u2019re still anxiously waiting for their next tweet or YouTube video to tell you what to do.\n\n- Stop trying to impress people. This is just good general life advice, but it applies triply so to this space. Wanting to impress your friends and family is one thing, wanted to impress random anons on the internet? Insanity.\n\n- There\u2019s Bitcoin, and then there\u2019s everything else. It took me too long to truly realize this. Yes alts can and will occasionally outperform - sometimes for long stretches of time - but basically everything bleeds to Bitcoin over the long run. \n\n- Most people try to outperform Bitcoin by trading these alts; probably leas than 5% of people can actually accomplish this. It\u2019s like trying to outperform the S&P 500. Most people are better off just buying the index.\n\n- This place has a way of warping your perspective to a level that is literally bordering on mental illness. Many of us refused to sell jpegs of a list of words for $50,000 last cycle because we thought \u201cit\u2019s undervalued\u201d. Many otherwise smart people. You are not immune. Herd mentality is real, it takes *a lot* to swim against the current around here. You should try.\n\n- Extending from that point, try and zoom out and also spend time with non-crypto people. 1 SOL or 0.08 ETH can seem like not significant amounts of money (unit bias is real), but add up how much that is per day or year and think what you could do with that money IRL. Also, most people are thrilled to earn a 10% return on their investments in a YEAR, and rightfully so. That\u2019s a great return, crypto just warps everything.\n\n- Compound interest is mind boggling powerful. You don\u2019t need to find a 100x, you\u2019re usually way better off stringing together a bunch of 2x plays or even compounding at 10-50% a year (do the math, do you have any idea how insane compound interest is at high %s over a bunch of years?)\n\n- Put another way: \u201cMost people overestimate what they can achieve in a year and underestimate what they can achieve in ten years.\u201d\n\nIf you found this insightful, all I ask is that you drop a bookmark, share with a friend, and/or subscribe to my newsletter where I share a lot more \ud83d\ude4f\n\nCheers\"\n5. Tweet by @dotkrueger (similarity score: 0.2332): \"For the last two-three years we had to listen to Yellen and Powell insist that \"the economy was great\" and \"banks were incredibly strong\".\n\nThis was BS. Jobs numbers were being propped up by massive Government hires. Bank \"health\" was the result of \"innovative\" programs like the \"BTFP\", and \"paying depositors 0.1% while earning 5%\". \n\nConsumers managed to spend their way out of Covid by massively ramping up credit card debt. The average card balance is being financed at a mind boggling 29% APR. This can't continue.\n\nThe deficit has gotten completely out of control. Interest payments are 1 Trillion per year, exceeding defense.\n\nWe need to stop this insanity. Rates need to come down. Massive DEI Government Hiring sprees need to go in reverse. Banks need to stop being protected by the Fed and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nWe need to let AI and Crypto do their things. Let the machines take over. Let DeFi replace banks. Adopt Bitcoin as Hard Money store of Value.\"\n\n\nNow, Last month was the first time in 2.5 years that I spent more than I made, and I didn\u2019t like how that felt. So I decided to do something about it."

            <td class="tweet-cell">We recreated Polymarket on Scroll in under three weeks... all because we fucked up.

The real story? We started with a dream of building a lending protocol for Polymarket—an idea I was shocked no one had tackled before, given the data. The math was obvious: traders NEED to lock up massive capital in prediction markets and hold positions until market close. That capital sits there, unutilized. Inefficient. Wasteful. For months.

But when we entered Scroll Open, we hit our first wall: we'd need to build on Scroll. Impossible to directly interface with Polymarket. So what did we do? We pivot. Hard.

We started with an idea, a prediction market. But not just any market—we wanted something new. A platform where financial participation drives real world outcomes. Think futarchy + prediction markets. We spent weeks on figuring out the system, ensuring there was no way to exploit it. It had the potential to deliver huge impact and it was something close to our hearts, it was transformative.

Then came the questions that every founder dreads: "How will you get users?" "Targeting regen & social impact seriously limits your TAM." "You won't scale." I wanted to ignore them. I tried to ignore them. But when the same feedback keeps hitting you from every direction, you have to listen.

So I looked at @Scroll_ZKP itself—objectively, brutally. The chain had hemorrhaged from $1B TVL down to $80M. 24h DEX volume? A mere $1M with only 5,000 active wallets in the past day. These weren't just numbers. This was a reality check. We went back to users and asked what they actually wanted in a prediction market. The answer was clear: rewards and unlocked liquidity.

That's when everything clicked. We'd build Polymarket on Scroll, but with our original innovation intact: integrated lending and borrowing. The first of its kind. A prediction market where your positions don’t just sit there, they work for you.

With just two developers—the same powerhouse builders who've brought countless products to life for our clients at @elvtd_io, we compressed what should have been months of work into mere weeks. We skipped building a CLOB because time was tight. But my team is beyond cracked. Huge shoutout to @cheekychain who created designs that are literally turning heads. We built. We tested. We iterated. We delivered.

And here's the most important thing I learned: We're not here just to win a hackathon. We're not building for 6 weeks. We're building for 6 months. For years. For the future. Because the true test of an entrepreneur isn't sticking stubbornly to your original vision—it's having the courage to adapt when reality demands it. It's about building something that will last. That will scale. That will actually work.

So yes, we pivoted from our heart project. But in finding what the market actually needed, we discovered something even more powerful: a path to sustainable impact.

Prediction markets with $30M daily volume + integrated lending? That's not just a hackathon project. That's a protocol with staying power.

Immensely proud of what we've accomplished. Wildly excited for what's next. This isn't the end. It's barely the beginning. Don’t fade @foresightnow.

Chapter 2 starts tomorrow.\"\n5. Tweet by @CryptoTraalala (similarity score: 0.3904): \"Missed Uniswap? Don't make the same mistake twice.\n\nEkubo is everything Uniswap should have been, but even better. Faster, cheaper, and more efficient.\n\nAnd it's already live on Starknet and Ethereum.\n\nDon't sleep on this \ud83d\udc47\n\n1. What is @EkuboProtocol\n\nEkubo is a concentrated liquidity market maker on @Starknet.\n\nIt allows liquidity providers to concentrate their funds within specific price ranges, making trading more efficient with lower slippage and better capital efficiency.\n\nBasically, Ekubo is a better version of Uniswap on Starknet and Ethereum.\n\n2. Why is Ekubo Better And What Set it Apart ?\n\nEkuboProtocol is designed to improve Uniswap\u2019s model in several key areas, particularly in gas efficiency, capital efficiency, and customization:\n\n1\u20e3 Gas Efficiency: Lower Fees for Traders and LPs\n\n\u2022 Singleton Contract Design\n\nUnlike traditional AMMs where each pool has a separate smart contract, Ekubo manages all pools within a single contract.\n\nThis means when you interact with multiple pools in a single transaction (e.g., swapping across different token pairs), you don\u2019t need to call multiple contracts and therefore saving gas.\n\nIn a result, Ekubo is about 20% cheaper than Uniswap v3 and v4 for simple swaps, and even more cost-effective for multi-step swaps. Therefore, providers can earn better returns without needing as much capital as on other platforms.\n\n2\u20e3 The \u201cTill\u201d Pattern\n\nNormally, every swap or liquidity update involves immediate token transfers, which increase gas costs.\n\nInstead, Ekubo defers token transfers until the end of the transaction, batching them together for efficiency.\n\nResult: Swaps and liquidity management on Ekubo are cheaper than on other AMM, making it more attractive for high-frequency traders and LPs.\n\nEkubo is always one step ahead as these innovations were only implemented only in Uniswap V4, making Ekubo a pioneer in introducing them.\n\n3\u20e3 Concentrated liquidity\n\nEven though Uniswap v4 improves gas efficiency, Ekubo still has a 100 X smaller tick size than Uniswap, meaning liquidity is much more concentrated. It means $1,000 in liquidity on Ekubo works as effectively as $100K on other AMMs.\n\nLPs can focus their capital within a specific price range, increasing capital efficiency.\n\nIn traditional AMMs, liquidity is spread evenly across all possible prices, meaning a large portion of liquidity remains unused (except if the market price moves significantly)\n\nEkubo uses concentrated liquidity, allowing LPs to provide liquidity only within a specific price range of their choice. This means:\n\n\u2022 LPs can allocate their capital more efficiently to the price ranges where most trading occurs.\n\n\u2022 Traders get better price execution with lower slippage since more liquidity is available at the trading price.\n\n\u2022  LPs earn higher returns because their capital is actively used rather than sitting and being unused.\n\nWhile Uniswap V4 optimizes Uni tick size, the extent of those optimizations still not match Ekubo's in terms of how concentrated and efficient liquidity can be deployed within smaller ranges.\n\n4\u20e3 Withdrawal Fee Incentives for LPs\n\nEkubo employs a fee switch mechanism that charges a fee on liquidity provider (LP) withdrawals equal to the fee tier of the pool. This creates a unique incentive for LPs to stay in the pool longer and allows the protocol to generate revenue.\n\nIn the future, as the protocol continues to grow, Ekubo will likely use its TWAMM (Time-Weighted Automated Market Maker) extension to automate buybacks of $EKUBO using protocol revenue, with the repurchased tokens being distributed to stakers with a model significantly more attractive compared to Uniswap\u2019s fee switch which focuses on redistributing trading fees for governance and token value enhancement.\n\n5\u20e3 DCA Feature\n\nEkubo offers a feature called DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) via its first extension, the TWAMM (Time-Weighted Average Market Maker), which enables users to execute token sales over a specified time period. This feature is available in the user interface as \"DCA orders\" and \"DCA-enabled\" pools.\n\nGreat thread about Ekubo\u2019s DCA: https://t.co/tXsbr7Z1b0\n\n6\u20e3 Permissionless Extensions for Developers\n\nEkubo allows developers to create custom pool types, such as on-chain oracles or limit orders. This enables more flexibility and customization for advanced DeFi strategies, while Uniswap v4 introduces some flexibility, but Ekubo's focus on permissionless extensions provides more room for custom DeFi products.\n\n7\u20e3 Multihook\n\nMultihook makes Ekubo more powerful by allowing multiple upgrades (extensions) to be added to a single liquidity pool instead of just one. This means developers can mix and match different features, control how they work together, and test new ideas without having to rebuild the pool from scratch. With support for up to 16 extensions, Multihook makes DeFi on Ekubo more flexible, customizable, and ready for advanced improvements like A51 Carbon (an initiative by Ekubo Protocol focused on advanced liquidity customization)\n\n8\u20e3 Open Source Privacy Pools for Starknet\n\nEkubo has open-sourced an implementation of Privacy Pools for Starknet, inspired by the Privacy Pools concept introduced by Vitalik Buterin and others as an evolution of Tornado Cash.\n\nPrivacy Pools aim to balance financial privacy with regulatory compliance by allowing users to prove their funds originate from a legitimate set of deposits without revealing specific details.\n\nBy bringing this feature to Starknet, Ekubo invites the community to contribute to a more private (but compliant) financial ecosystem.\n\n3. Ekubo Token and DAO\n\nThe EKUBO token has a total supply of 10 million tokens, distributed equally across three categories:\n\n\u2022 Airdrop: 1/3 of the supply was distributed to users\n\n\u2022 Team: 1/3 of the supply was distributed to the team\n\n\u2022 DAO: 1/3 of the supply was distributed to the DAO and was sold to buy ETH, USDC, and STRK using Ekubo\u2019s DCA order feature\n\nThe Ekubo protocol is fully owned and operated by the DAO, with core contracts under its control rather than a multisig, reinforcing its commitment to decentralization.\n\nBoth the airdrop and team allocations were fully vested at TGE, while the DAO\u2019s portion was sold gradually after which EKUBO became fully diluted.\n\nThe DAO sale raised over $3 million combined with the DAO\u2019s revenue and the Starknet Catalyst grant where Ekubo was the top recipient with 6 Millions STRK received (=approx. $4.2M at that time)\n\nEkubo, Inc. is the creator of Ekubo Protocol, and the Ekubo DAO.\n\nTo sustain its role in the ecosystem, the company requested a $1.5M grant from the DAO to fund operations for the next two years, ensuring continued development without further funding.\n\nKey Commitments:\n\n\u2022 Develop & maintain core Ekubo contracts (including Cairo updates)\n\n\u2022 Launch an on-chain limit order extension\n\n\u2022 Design a revenue distribution framework for EKUBO stakers (Q1 2025)\n\n\u2022 Host & maintain the Ekubo Interface (free for users)\n\n\u2022 Provide governance tooling, developer support, and public API access\n\n\u2022 Never sell the company's allocated 33.3% EKUBO tokens\n\nThe DAO will transfer $1.5M in ETH, STRK, and USDC to fund these efforts, covering 3-4 full-time hires.\n\n$EKUBO Token:\n\nFor months EKUBO traded at 1$ / $EKUBO offering users the opportunity to buy at very low prices, and is now trading at >5X compared to its price at TGE, which is without any doubt a MASSIVE performance.\n\nEkubo does not rely only on their token. Their diversified approach improves financial stability and transparency.\n\nAdditionally, Ekubo's sale structure guaranteed that public buyers received the same terms as insiders, without later token unlocks, addressing the common concern that new tokens are often dominated by private market allocations.\n\n4. Ekubo Adoption\n\nWhile Volume and TVL stagnate for Ekubo, it is the same for Uni, mostly due to current market conditions\n\nFurthermore, Ekubo has recently launched on Ethereum, which is expected to enhance its metrics and further its ambition to expand across other EVM chains. DEX aggregators on Ethereum, such as @matchaxyz, have already integrated Ekubo.\n\nWith projects like RosettaNET bringing EVM wallets to Starknet and the development of the Open Intent Framework, users will soon be able to seamlessly switch between chains, using their favorite wallets on Ekubo with ease.\n\n5. What\u2019s next ?\n\n\u2022 Focus on Ethereum for the next few months\n\n\u2022 TWAMM extension on Ethereum\n\n\u2022 Limit order extension\n\n\u2022 Deploying on other EVM chains\n\n6. Why Will Ekubo Succeed ?\n\nAs Uniswap, Ekubo\n\u2714 Is Capital-Efficient AMM \n\u2714 Is Decentralized / DAO-led governance, ensuring community control.\n\u2714 Has Strong Token Incentives\n\u2714 Has User-Centric interface\n\nBut Better, Because: \n\n\ud83c\udf1f Deployed on Starknet: Lower Fees, Higher Throughput\n\nUnlike Uniswap on Ethereum, Ekubo benefits from ultra-low transaction costs and high scalability, making it more accessible for traders and LPs.\n\n\ud83c\udf1f Improved Capital Efficiency\n\nAdvanced concentrated liquidity mechanisms and on-chain limit orders give liquidity providers more control and better returns than Uniswap v4.\n\n\ud83c\udf1f Modular and Flexible Architecture\n\nEkubo is designed to evolve rapidly, allowing for permissionless DeFi innovation and easy integration of new liquidity strategies and optimizations.\n\n\ud83c\udf1f Cross-Chain Expansion\n\nWith its Ethereum expansion and plans for multi-chain support.\n\n\ud83c\udf1f A Chad & Bold Team that Perfectly Understands the Market\n\nLed by Moody Salem, Ekubo is building with strong fundamentals and long-term vision.\"\n\n\nNow, We recreated Polymarket on Scroll in under three weeks... all because we fucked up.\n\nThe real story? We started with a dream of building a lending protocol for Polymarket\u2014an idea I was shocked no one had tackled before, given the data. The math was obvious: traders NEED to lock up massive capital in prediction markets and hold positions until market close. That capital sits there, unutilized. Inefficient. Wasteful. For months.\n\nBut when we entered Scroll Open, we hit our first wall: we'd need to build on Scroll. Impossible to directly interface with Polymarket. So what did we do? We pivot. Hard.\n\nWe started with an idea, a prediction market. But not just any market\u2014we wanted something new. A platform where financial participation drives real world outcomes. Think futarchy + prediction markets. We spent weeks on figuring out the system, ensuring there was no way to exploit it. It had the potential to deliver huge impact and it was something close to our hearts, it was transformative.\n\nThen came the questions that every founder dreads: \"How will you get users?\" \"Targeting regen & social impact seriously limits your TAM.\" \"You won't scale.\" I wanted to ignore them. I tried to ignore them. But when the same feedback keeps hitting you from every direction, you have to listen.\n\nSo I looked at @Scroll_ZKP itself\u2014objectively, brutally. The chain had hemorrhaged from $1B TVL down to $80M. 24h DEX volume? A mere $1M with only 5,000 active wallets in the past day. These weren't just numbers. This was a reality check. We went back to users and asked what they actually wanted in a prediction market. The answer was clear: rewards and unlocked liquidity.\n\nThat's when everything clicked. We'd build Polymarket on Scroll, but with our original innovation intact: integrated lending and borrowing. The first of its kind. A prediction market where your positions don\u2019t just sit there, they work for you.\n\nWith just two developers\u2014the same powerhouse builders who've brought countless products to life for our clients at @elvtd_io, we compressed what should have been months of work into mere weeks. We skipped building a CLOB because time was tight. But my team is beyond cracked. Huge shoutout to @cheekychain who created designs that are literally turning heads. We built. We tested. We iterated. We delivered.\n\nAnd here's the most important thing I learned: We're not here just to win a hackathon. We're not building for 6 weeks. We're building for 6 months. For years. For the future. Because the true test of an entrepreneur isn't sticking stubbornly to your original vision\u2014it's having the courage to adapt when reality demands it. It's about building something that will last. That will scale. That will actually work.\n\nSo yes, we pivoted from our heart project. But in finding what the market actually needed, we discovered something even more powerful: a path to sustainable impact.\n\nPrediction markets with $30M daily volume + integrated lending? That's not just a hackathon project. That's a protocol with staying power.\n\nImmensely proud of what we've accomplished. Wildly excited for what's next. This isn't the end. It's barely the beginning. Don\u2019t fade @foresightnow.\n\nThank you to @razacodes @_emjlin @sandyzkp @natonchain @rh_bdl @defidennis for the constant feedbacks & support \ud83e\udef6 And my incredible devs @MadunProt0col @mengoo6988 who pushed through challenges most would have crumbled under \ud83d\udd25"

Yet their words have echoed so far and destroyed people over and over again this cycle.\n\n\"Eth will some day be 10k\"- How many people have sat here longing eth all cycle while getting liquidated, or even holding spot and underperforming EVERYTHING while SOL went 20x+\n\n\"Your biggest fear is being underallocated in the industry you log onto everyday..\" \n\nOKAY. I BETTER STAY LOCKED IN AND GET MORE EXPOSURE TO LDO AND ETH. A notion that only generated more fomo anytime people thought alt season was on the horizon.\n(Oh fuck I don't have enough! I better make up for this and overcompensate)\n\nAimless, baseless advice and idealogy that means little to nothing as far as actionable or helpful to current participants.\n\nWe need new guards. We need people to have their own brains.\n\nRise up. Maybe create something cool. Goodnight.\"\n3.

There has to be SOME sort of relationship between valuation and a modicum of real world usage.\n\nUntil then, we bleed. As well we should.\"\n4. Tweet by @wassielawyer (similarity score: 0.3170): \"Unsolicited late night thoughts on how to fix the crypto venture financing / altcoin space.\n\n1. Make '% of Company Reserve' meta again. \n\nIn 2022, it was a lot more common to see private investors invest into projects and receive a % of Company Reserve v.s. % of FDV. This means when I invest 1m at 100m, I don't get 1% of total FDV. I get 1% of whatever the team supply is (so if its 20%, I get 0.2%). \n\nThis creates a situation where investor and team are more aligned and far less tokens are being emitted.\n\nThis has fallen off a lot more recently although I still rarely see them with good projects and strong founders.\n\nSure, this means you will raise less money at lower vals which leads me to my next point.\n\n2. Raise less, at lower valuations\n\nLets get real here. 90% of projects don't need 10m+ dollars pre-PMF to build a dApp or a chain. We all know half of you fork code and/or outsource most of your shit to Eastern Europe / SEA / LatAm anyway.\n\nRaising at lower vals means you don't get pressure to launch at retarded vals where the only buyer is the MM you pay (using the 5m dollars you have left after exorbitant salaries and parties). \n\n3. Make the fair launch actually fair\n\nIf you are going to do a 'fair launch' make it actually fair. That means allowing everyone to participate on clearly defined parameters that are not based on who you know or how early you are.\n\nFair launch + getting an MM to snipe your own launch is retarded. Echo rounds where access is gated is retarded. Nobody wants to be someone else's exit liquidity because he knew a guy or got in early. \n\n4. Time based unlock for team makes zero sense\n\nWhy is the team's economics tied to an arbitrary period of time? Shouldn't it be correlated to... actually making the product work?\n\nThis disincentivizes all the market-making nonsense where a team basically just tries to manage token price until the unlocks happen.\n\n5. The token is not the product\n\nFounders need to build something actually useful that people want to use instead of simply paying KOLs to shill the token, TVL providers / liquid funds to counterfeit retail activity and market makers to play the same ponzi game that everyone is playing.\n\n 6. Exchanges should moderate\n\nI'm surprised that exchanges have generally participated in a race to the bottom by competing for listings rather than actually creating strict listing rules and sanctioning projects that do not abide.\n\nActually I'm not surprised because they get fat listing fees + the ponzi projects have the most volume thanks to a literal army of market makers.\n\nI am Wassie in suit ranting. Not legal or financial advice.\"\n5. Tweet by @novogratz (similarity score: 0.3088): \"Crypto musings\u2026\n\n1. The announcements yesterday were huge.  Historical.

            <td class="tweet-cell">When an Entrepreneur Meets Nation Builders

My fascination with history and science has always gone beyond textbooks. I’ve dived deep into couple of IAS curriculum courses—not for a career in civil service, but simply because I love learning how the world works.

And that same curiosity recently took me somewhere extraordinary: the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA) in Mussoorie.

I was invited to speak with 140 civil service officers from the 2004 batch, part of the government’s mid-career training program. But this wasn’t just another talk.

Let’s be honest—when you think of bureaucrats, you probably picture rigid rules, red tape, and an army of file-pushers. But these officers? They shattered every stereotype.

Sharp. Fearless. Unapologetically curious.

What was supposed to be a presentation on OYO’s journey quickly turned into a rapid-fire exchange of ideas. They didn’t want a well-rehearsed speech. They wanted the raw, unfiltered truth.

"How do you tackle regulatory hurdles in an ever-changing landscape?"
"What’s the one thing that keeps you up at night when scaling a company?"
"Where do business and governance truly intersect—and where do they clash?"

Their questions weren’t just insightful; they cut straight to the core of real-world challenges.

And that’s when I had my biggest realization—there’s an untapped synergy between private sector agility and public sector vision. These officers aren’t just running systems; they’re rethinking them. They’re strategists, problem-solvers, and in many ways, entrepreneurs in their own right.

I walked into LBSNAA expecting to share knowledge. I walked out with a renewed perspective.

Because sometimes, the most game-changing conversations happen in the most unexpected places.

Tweet by @Akshay001 (similarity score: 0.3501): \"Thank you, dear Meeera & Sameer Jain, for having me / Leverage over at the @EconomicTimes Corporate Excellence Awards. Having only read about it since I was a school kid, felt quite the deal to attend it this very first time. And what spectacular show it was \u2728 \ud83e\uddda \n\nWas great to meet some early Leverage believers, some old friends in the startup land, and some others who I\u2019ve wanted to meet for the longest time. To top it, the event had an incredible dose of inspiration, top to bottom, pure fuel! \n\nMy top three moments:\n- when N Chandrasekaran came to share some words about Bharat\u2019s jewel, Sir Ratan Tata, he recalled the time when he\u2019d made a request to renovate Bombay House, and Mr. Tata\u2019s response, after a few moments, was \u201cwhere will the dogs go\u201d \u2026. It pierced right through, something I deeply desire to achieve in life \n- one of our own, Peyush Bansal of Lenskart, also an early believer in Leverage, winning the Entrepreneur of Year award, and his wife\u2019s note following that; its powering because it somehow signals that \u201cif we work hard enough, we will get there\u201d\n- Business Leader of the Year, Kumar Mangalam Birla Sir\u2019s note, when he almost choked up .. I\u2019ve (by his good grace) had the chance to meet him a couple times in the last few years, but wouldn\u2019t have ever reckoned him getting a tad emotional, and rightly so though, the impact \u201cjust he has had\u201d on the Birla Group, over last 30 years, that ability to survive and continue to win irrespective how many times they write you off, is so so powerful!\n\nET continues to be a beacon of business leadership in India. Glad that they are taking us into the future with focus on sustainability plus frontier technology, hand-in-hand :)\n\nThank you to all the awesome leaders I\u2019ve had a chance to engage with in the past in the ET ecosystem, @sruthijith @prachivermaET @sreeradhabasuET @RicaB_ET @Indulekha_A @IshaniDg @digbijaymishra1 @samidhas @brindasET @jessicarajan @GhaiNeil @pranavmukul\"\n3. Tweet by @pzakin (similarity score: 0.2741): \"Nearly 2 years into my transition to being an investor, a few notes:\n\n- My 1 liner of what I look for: exceptional founders building something radical (that people want). Radical companies feel a bit strange; what feels normal is usually territory for incumbents.\n\n- The epitaph for my career as a founder is that I cared more about ideas than customers. It's hard for me to get excited by founders who seem likely to make my mistakes. It's not a movie I like to rewatch.\n\n- The companies I've gotten most excited about are not companies that reaffirm my theses (I'm pretty self-conscious about confirmation bias) but the ones that manage to change my mind. \n\n- I think we under-appreciate how exceptional the best founders are. I think a lot about Brian Scalibrine: \"I'm way closer to Lebron than you are to me\". \n\n-  Talent vs. access. If you don't have Sequoia's access, you better hope you can mine talent in places they're not looking. As talent becomes more legible (Thiel fellowship, Prod, YC) it becomes harder to compete against firms that have better access.\"\n4. Tweet by @CryptoStatuette (similarity score: 0.2444): \"Based Community Building 103 \ud83d\udd35\n\nChapter 1: History\n\nI\u2019ve mentioned that my background is highly unconventional compared to many in our industry and my position didn\u2019t even exist at @base when I was hired. I\u2019m a trained archaeologist and a professional ceramic sculptor. So, I\u2019m often asked how I fell in love with the Based Builder community and dedicated my life to building the global onchain economy with them.\n\nIt all makes sense when viewed from my perspective which is shaped by my insights as an archaeologist, years of studying how societies evolve, adapt, and innovate over time. Studying ancient civilizations reveals one consistent truth: societies that fail to adapt to new paradigms collapse under their own rigidity. As Lao Tzu said, \u201cThe hard and stiff will be broken, the soft and supple will prevail.\u201d\n\nI could clearly see that the same is true for the institutions of our age, and that decentralized blockchain technology is the solution to many of the challenges we face today.\n\nAfter years of leadership roles in large crypto communities, I saw that what @base is building aligns most closely with my vision. So, I chose to commit to change, to be part of something greater than myself and to help build equal opportunities for EVERYONE across the globe. \n\nThat\u2019s where it all began.\n\nRight now, we are experiencing the labor pains of a new global onchain economy, one that increases innovation, creativity, and freedom at an unprecedented scale. Those who cling to outdated, centralized models will become the boomers of the next century, relics of an era that failed to evolve.\"\n5. Tweet by @easonchaiii (similarity score: 0.2412): \"We recreated Polymarket on Scroll in under three weeks... all because we fucked up.\n\nThe real story? We started with a dream of building a lending protocol for Polymarket\u2014an idea I was shocked no one had tackled before, given the data. The math was obvious: traders NEED to lock up massive capital in prediction markets and hold positions until market close. That capital sits there, unutilized. Inefficient. Wasteful. For months.\n\nBut when we entered Scroll Open, we hit our first wall: we'd need to build on Scroll. Impossible to directly interface with Polymarket. So what did we do? We pivot. Hard.\n\nWe started with an idea, a prediction market. But not just any market\u2014we wanted something new. A platform where financial participation drives real world outcomes. Think futarchy + prediction markets. We spent weeks on figuring out the system, ensuring there was no way to exploit it. It had the potential to deliver huge impact and it was something close to our hearts, it was transformative.\n\nThen came the questions that every founder dreads: \"How will you get users?\" \"Targeting regen & social impact seriously limits your TAM.\" \"You won't scale.\" I wanted to ignore them. I tried to ignore them. But when the same feedback keeps hitting you from every direction, you have to listen.\n\nSo I looked at @Scroll_ZKP itself\u2014objectively, brutally. The chain had hemorrhaged from $1B TVL down to $80M. 24h DEX volume? A mere $1M with only 5,000 active wallets in the past day. These weren't just numbers. This was a reality check. We went back to users and asked what they actually wanted in a prediction market. The answer was clear: rewards and unlocked liquidity.\n\nThat's when everything clicked. We'd build Polymarket on Scroll, but with our original innovation intact: integrated lending and borrowing. The first of its kind. A prediction market where your positions don\u2019t just sit there, they work for you.\n\nWith just two developers\u2014the same powerhouse builders who've brought countless products to life for our clients at @elvtd_io, we compressed what should have been months of work into mere weeks. We skipped building a CLOB because time was tight. But my team is beyond cracked. Huge shoutout to @cheekychain who created designs that are literally turning heads. We built. We tested. We iterated. We delivered.\n\nAnd here's the most important thing I learned: We're not here just to win a hackathon. We're not building for 6 weeks. We're building for 6 months. For years. For the future. Because the true test of an entrepreneur isn't sticking stubbornly to your original vision\u2014it's having the courage to adapt when reality demands it. It's about building something that will last. That will scale. That will actually work.\n\nSo yes, we pivoted from our heart project. But in finding what the market actually needed, we discovered something even more powerful: a path to sustainable impact.\n\nPrediction markets with $30M daily volume + integrated lending? That's not just a hackathon project. That's a protocol with staying power.\n\nImmensely proud of what we've accomplished. Wildly excited for what's next. This isn't the end. It's barely the beginning. Don\u2019t fade @foresightnow.\n\nThank you to @razacodes @_emjlin @sandyzkp @natonchain @rh_bdl @defidennis for the constant feedbacks & support \ud83e\udef6 And my incredible devs @MadunProt0col @mengoo6988 who pushed through challenges most would have crumbled under \ud83d\udd25\"\n\n\nNow, When an Entrepreneur Meets Nation Builders\n\nMy fascination with history and science has always gone beyond textbooks.
