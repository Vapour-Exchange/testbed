With Trump scaling down U.S. support, European leaders just approved billions to strengthen their own defenses.

At a high-stakes summit, 26 out of 27 EU nations backed a plan to boost military funding and reaffirmed support for Ukraine. Hungary refused to sign.

Macron says Europe is in a ‚Äúnew era‚Äù and must prepare to stand on its own‚Äîwhether the U.S. is on board or not.

Of course I am thrilled at the idea of a strategic reserve in the US where bitcoin is finally being recognized. But as someone who at times must be contrarian in seeking alpha, here are my thoughts for the many who follow me because I speak my mind for which I hope you\u2019ll appreciate that my views are still at large as aligned with anyone else who wants to see broad bitcoin adoption at the sovereign level\u2013\n\nPeople are comparing the EO strategic reserve as a breakthrough moment like when the Bitcoin spot ETFs launched, where the ST price action might go down near term but eventual institutional flows would come in and this would be a game changer. I disagree with this comparison. I think this is more similar to the ProShares futures-based Bitcoin ETF launch moment in 2021. Because while it is true that BITO raised a lot of money at the peak of market exuberance, it also found a material ceiling for \u201creal flows\u201d as the product itself was fundamentally flawed. It also did not start the expected global arms race of spot ETFs to launch elsewhere.  Eventually, we would learn that we really needed the real thing, the spot ETF 3 years later to truly unleash the moment. We needed the US to first launch the real thing, not the fake thing, for the rest of the world to follow. Yet make no mistake that BITO was helpful in bridging the gap.\n\nIn my opinion, EO Strategic Reserve represents a similarly imperfect outcome. An EO is a singular political directive that can stick or disappear as easily as Biden\u2019s EO on gender-affirming care for minors or the EO that sought to restrain the AI industry. Without the collective power of legislation that reflects the will of the people\u2019s coalition building, it is not likely the game-changing thing that kicks off a bunch of second order things people expect. People are generally already suspicious of the overreach of executive authority and one must account for there being a net negative that comes with these types of theatrics as well, especially for non-believers. So the question is: did we get enough net benefits against the costs?\n\nAt the core, we all know Trump is a transparently transactional person. He recognized that bitcoin, whether he believes in it or not, symbolized the ethos of his political capital and capitalized its base to the max to win the office. And all of this visually came down to this moment last night when you watch the video of his signing the EO. Before signing, he asks two questions: 1) \"This is something YOU believe in, right?\" 2) \"And I made the promise, right?\" What is happening here is a total relinquishment by transaction consummation. Trump is now officially \u201coff the hook\u201d for what the Bitcoin community did for him. If you want something else later, he\u2019ll want something else from now on.\n\nAnd so in my humble opinion, we asked for too little. Having only bitcoin and not the rest of the altcoins in the strategic reserve is not a win. \u201cExploring\u201d or \u201cstudying\u201d concepts is not a win. \u201cNot selling\u201d is not a win. None of these things at the core require an EO at all to do anything. They are merely symbolic things that may kick off some events (or it may not). Comparing the current environment to Operation Chokepoint 2.0 and claiming we should now be \u201cgrateful\u201d makes it sound like \u201cbeing neutral\u201d is itself a win. It\u2019s not. Chokepoint 2.0, SAB 121 were evil things. That can\u2019t be the benchmark for our industry to feel like we are owed to feel grateful for anything else. For the Bitcoin Roundtable fundraiser to have been one of the largest contributors to his election campaign, one must ask if this the \u201cstrategic reserve deal\u201d that people had in mind at the time versus now. The fact that the Polymarket bet \u201cWill Trump create bitcoin reserve in the first 100 days?\u201d is still sitting at <50% \u201cyes\u201d today reflects the ambiguity of this expectation. In other words, promises were made, but the market is not sure if promises were kept, though the one thing for sure is that now Trump is off the hook.\n\nMaybe this is the best we can do for now. It doesn\u2019t mean the crypto council, policymakers, lobbyists and the executive team are not doing all the best they can. I\u2019m sure they did and are. At the same time, it is rational to consider disappointment if this represents the culminating moment of peak performance since November and consider this is a short-term bearish set up. We are so used to being treated so badly that we are conditioned to think every small thing is the biggest win ever. My one ask for the industry is that we strive to set our bars higher, where we demand really meaningful things so we can celebrate really meaningful things, especially as we head into the heat of the two most important things that will come out of Congress: market structure and stablecoin legislations. We deserve it, and we helped elect a lot of people for it. Hold them all accountable for real progress. Then after the hard work is done, let's celebrate those wins when we cross the finish line.\"\n3.

Comparing the current environment to Operation Chokepoint 2.0 and claiming we should now be \u201cgrateful\u201d makes it sound like \u201cbeing neutral\u201d is itself a win. It\u2019s not. Chokepoint 2.0, SAB 121 were evil things. That can\u2019t be the benchmark for our industry to feel like we are owed to feel grateful for anything else. For the Bitcoin Roundtable fundraiser to have been one of the largest contributors to his election campaign, one must ask if this the \u201cstrategic reserve deal\u201d that people had in mind at the time versus now. The fact that the Polymarket bet \u201cWill Trump create bitcoin reserve in the first 100 days?\u201d is still sitting at <50% \u201cyes\u201d today reflects the ambiguity of this expectation. In other words, promises were made, but the market is not sure if promises were kept, though the one thing for sure is that now Trump is off the hook.\n\nMaybe this is the best we can do for now. It doesn\u2019t mean the crypto council, policymakers, lobbyists and the executive team are not doing all the best they can. I\u2019m sure they did and are. At the same time, it is rational to consider disappointment if this represents the culminating moment of peak performance since November and consider this is a short-term bearish set up. We are so used to being treated so badly that we are conditioned to think every small thing is the biggest win ever. My one ask for the industry is that we strive to set our bars higher, where we demand really meaningful things so we can celebrate really meaningful things, especially as we head into the heat of the two most important things that will come out of Congress: market structure and stablecoin legislations. We deserve it, and we helped elect a lot of people for it. Hold them all accountable for real progress. Then after the hard work is done, let's celebrate those wins when we cross the finish line.\"\n4. Tweet by @Steve_4P (similarity score: 0.4465): \"Buying #Bitcoin might have been a bit burdensome.\n\nIn fact, even though this Bitcoin Strategic Reserve EO is quite positive news, I think the market is selling off because expectations for Trump were too high.\n\nConsidering @worldlibertyfi and @EricTrump's statements so far, it would have been reasonable to expect not just the government strategically reserving Bitcoin it already owns, but also steadily purchasing more Bitcoin, and even possibly extending purchases to major altcoins(namely, $ETH, and $SOL).\n\nHowever, in a situation where public perception of Bitcoin isn't extremely positive yet, the act of purchasing Bitcoin with government funds could potentially conflict with the \"don't waste money on unnecessary things\" agenda(@DOGE Agenda) that the Trump administration is currently promoting.\n\nOf course, whether investing in Bitcoin is a waste of money - from my perspective or industry insiders' view, it isn't - but from an outsider's perspective, it certainly could be seen that way. And since markets won't always perform well, during price declines or bear markets, there would certainly be critical public opinion about \"purchasing Bitcoin.\"\n\nI think they might have recognized these aspects as well.\n\nNevertheless, I believe it's positive enough just knowing that Bitcoin seized by the government in the future might not be sold on the market but rather continuously reserved by the government.\n\nI think it's better not to have too high expectations about Trump calling himself the \"Crypto President.\" Politicians typically have a special talent for being the \"President for the common people\" in front of common people, and the \"President for businesses\" in front of businesspeople.\n\nWhile Trump is unlikely to view crypto negatively during his term, it also seems wise to abandon expectations that he'll make crypto his top priority. Crypto is just one of many political agenda for him.\"\n5. Tweet by @jamesob (similarity score: 0.4029): \"The government is willing to SBR because they feel that (in its current form) Bitcoin is not a threat to the dollar hegemony. Trump said as much yesterday.\n\nDoes that tell you something?\"\n\n\nNow, Whether you agree that the executive order is aggressive enough in buying Bitcoin, just pause for a moment to reflect on the fact Bitcoin has achieved full and complete political capture.\n\nOne of the greatest threats to Bitcoin's existence has been eliminated."

Valerie Costa isn‚Äôt just protesting‚Äîshe‚Äôs running a website that helps activists attack Tesla, proudly encouraging vandalism in the name of her crusade.

She openly admits her movement is inspired by Luigi Mangione and calls Elon‚Äôs DOGE initiative ‚Äúcriminal,‚Äù even though Trump won on a platform that backed it to fix the budget.

Valerie:

"We don't want to just waste our energy protesting for the sake of protesting.

Whether it was troublemakers or partners that we've been working with over the last few weeks, we've planned multiple actions at Tesla."

Tweet by @fede_intern (similarity score: 0.4956): \"\u201cWhat I mean: all based rollups are essentially a single sequencer that concatenates n chains together; but instead of doing it directly like a simple high-performance chain, it has to deal with political coordination and management of intricate security interdependencies of a dozen of teams. I can elaborate on the technical details if needed.\u201d\n\nIf this was correct I would agree with the rest. The thing is that it\u2019s not. \n\n1. based rollups are not a single sequencer. you can have as many sequencers as you want. it just means you\u2019re doing the sequencing in the same validator set of the l1\n2. sequencing has nothing to do with a high performance chain. it\u2019s just how you sequence the l1 with l2 or l2 witu l2s transaction. you do these things via the same box when you have transactions that go from one place to another\n3. token price of Ethereum is one of the reason why some people are doing this. i\u2019m not, i want composability between L2s. rollup clusters is fragmenting ethereum. we need a solution. users will win by having based rollups.\n4. there is no contradiction between scaling the L1 and based rollups. based rollups don\u2019t need any change in the L1. no need to put them as contradictory. it\u2019s like saying that making the L1 faster implies that we need to stop ZK from moving forward. you will see many solutions working in production very soon with different tradeoffs.\n\nbased rollups enable cross rollup interoperability. you talk about this needing political change and coordination but you propose to enshrine a shared bridge in ethereum. it\u2019s easier to launch new solutions that solve UX problems for users rather than convincing optimism or zksync to use the same shared bridge. your proposal is even more political.\n\nbased rollups will get more adoptions and people convinced by the month. they will happen, some clusters will move into it. others won\u2019t and that\u2019s ok. we can have different solutions but I believe the ones supporting based sequencing will have concrete advantages for many usecases.\"\n3.

I BETTER STAY LOCKED IN AND GET MORE EXPOSURE TO LDO AND ETH. A notion that only generated more fomo anytime people thought alt season was on the horizon.\n(Oh fuck I don't have enough!

Those who find this balance win in the long run. \n\nThe grind continues - $ZM HABIBIS!\"\n\n\nNow, Why is the timeline so heated and none of you is talking about $BOI ? @Boithebear \n\nI also saw the CEO @hakikiceo on the leaderboard grinding together with the community!\n\nJust engage, don\u2019t put so much expectations, if it cooks fine , if it doesn\u2019t still fine, value your mental health!"

Funny that Grok doesn't know where I live, even though I  list where I do on my X Profile and have talked about this many times here on X.

It was just one example that came up in an interesting conversation with @JoshuaJBouw and @bendiken about trustworthiness in AI and crypto (Joshua created the first proof of stake system). They visited my home, are visiting from Dubai.

Arto sees the world of AI needing to move to a new kind of AI that validates data and understands how it changes over time (and he's building such a system). Like my address. Most websites say I live in Half Moon Bay, because I did for 12 years, but Grok isn't smart enough to put together that my profile is more relevant for that than all the other data that built its LLM. 

Shows that Grok isn't strongly integrated here on X yet, too. I can't wait until it is, would love to have it watch my lists.

Tweet by @EricCLFung (similarity score: 0.3481): \"I have to be honest: \na huge part of why people are pushing AI and by extension, crypto-based AI agents infra is because there\u2019s money to be made.\n\nIt feels like a new wave of tech frenzy, with fresh projects and ICOs and IPOs emerging almost daily. The growth of AI combined with crypto agents will depend heavily on the capital that flows into these projects. \n\nOnce the hype is over, everything dumps. \n\nI\u2019m not saying these technologies lack value or can\u2019t evolve, but I do worry they could tighten the grip of \u201cBig Tech\u201d and large-scale corporate interests on our everyday lives. \n\nI realize this comparison might not be perfect, but I\u2019m already seeing less original content on social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok. Instead, there\u2019s been a surge in reaction videos to other people\u2019s material. Sure, they can be funny or entertaining, but they also point to a growing complacency. Maybe thats why a platform like KAITO and YAPs work so well.\n\nBy way of background, I\u2019ve bought my crypto in the web3 space since 2018. I\u2019ve built a few AI chatbots on my own, and my current startup uses AI to aggregate and validate genuine investors and startup connections. I\u2019ve also invested in multiple A.I. and web3 blockchain ventures, and I worked at a blockchain AGI company for the past year. I\u2019m fortunate to have sold and exited my first startup about eight years ago. Even now, helping under stealth on a Web3 AI project.\n\nNow, as I look to the future, I\u2019m worried about what this all means for things like essays, papers, and even our children\u2019s writing skills. Good writing has always been a challenge, and the rise of \u201cauto-generated\u201d solutions only makes it more vulnerable. Are we undermining genuine learning? Is critical thinking more important now than ever?\n\nSome of you might dismiss this as a typical \u201cGen X\u201d perspective (I\u2019m in my 30s). You might think I\u2019m clinging to the past or lack vision for the future. That\u2019s not the case at all. I see tremendous potential for AI whether it\u2019s robotics, predictive analytics, or algorithmic advancements. I also love how my Spotify and Youtube save me time and introduce me to new stuff. \n\nI\u2019m not burying my head in the sand when it comes to the capabilities of AI and crypto; I just worry about the erosion of genuine creativity and content creation. If we\u2019re not careful, these technologies that are supposed to liberate us could wind up diminishing the very skills and originality that make us human.\"\n4.

This rollout enhances the platform's functionality, making it easier for users to leverage Grok's capabilities without leaving their conversations.\n\nThe new feature lets users ask questions, get insights, or engage with discussions in real time, expanding Grok\u2019s role on the platform. \n\nWhether it's seeking clarification on a trending topic, generating quick summaries, or diving into detailed analyses, Grok 3 is designed to provide witty, insightful, and real-time responses, drawing on its extensive training and integration with X's live data.\n\nSource: X\"\n\n\nNow, Grok mistake:\n\nIt got something very basic wrong about me. I asked it where I live.\n\nFunny that Grok doesn't know where I live, even though I  list where I do on my X Profile and have talked about this many times here on X.\n\nIt was just one example that came up in an interesting conversation with @JoshuaJBouw and @bendiken about trustworthiness in AI and crypto (Joshua created the first proof of stake system). They visited my home, are visiting from Dubai.\n\nArto sees the world of AI needing to move to a new kind of AI that validates data and understands how it changes over time (and he's building such a system). Like my address. Most websites say I live in Half Moon Bay, because I did for 12 years, but Grok isn't smart enough to put together that my profile is more relevant for that than all the other data that built its LLM. \n\nShows that Grok isn't strongly integrated here on X yet, too. I can't wait until it is, would love to have it watch my lists. \n\nYet another reminder that we don't yet have AGI. \n\nAGI would get this right, wouldn't it?"
