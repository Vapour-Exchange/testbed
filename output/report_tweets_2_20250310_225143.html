With Trump scaling down U.S. support, European leaders just approved billions to strengthen their own defenses.

At a high-stakes summit, 26 out of 27 EU nations backed a plan to boost military funding and reaffirmed support for Ukraine. Hungary refused to sign.

Macron says Europe is in a “new era” and must prepare to stand on its own—whether the U.S. is on board or not.

Valerie Costa isn’t just protesting—she’s running a website that helps activists attack Tesla, proudly encouraging vandalism in the name of her crusade.

She openly admits her movement is inspired by Luigi Mangione and calls Elon’s DOGE initiative “criminal,” even though Trump won on a platform that backed it to fix the budget.

Valerie:

"We don't want to just waste our energy protesting for the sake of protesting.

Whether it was troublemakers or partners that we've been working with over the last few weeks, we've planned multiple actions at Tesla."

It got something very basic wrong about me. I asked it where I live.

Funny that Grok doesn't know where I live, even though I  list where I do on my X Profile and have talked about this many times here on X.

It was just one example that came up in an interesting conversation with @JoshuaJBouw and @bendiken about trustworthiness in AI and crypto (Joshua created the first proof of stake system). They visited my home, are visiting from Dubai.

Arto sees the world of AI needing to move to a new kind of AI that validates data and understands how it changes over time (and he's building such a system). Like my address. Most websites say I live in Half Moon Bay, because I did for 12 years, but Grok isn't smart enough to put together that my profile is more relevant for that than all the other data that built its LLM. 

Shows that Grok isn't strongly integrated here on X yet, too. I can't wait until it is, would love to have it watch my lists. 

Yet another reminder that we don't yet have AGI.
