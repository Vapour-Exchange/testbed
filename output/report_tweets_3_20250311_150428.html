            <td class="tweet-cell">Five years ago this week, the US & most of the world was locked down by politicians over “Covid19”.

By now it should be clear to all thinking people that this was both a scam of epic proportions and a gross violation of human rights.

We’ve never had a proper accounting of how and why this tyranny happened. 

Remember the videos of people dropping dead in the streets?  We now know they were fake. Remember the “ventilator shortages”?  Remember the hospital ships coming to relieve the “full” hospitals?  Remember the concerns of morgues overflowing?   All of it was a sham.   

The academics, the scientists, the NGOs, the politicians, the medical community - they were all wrong.  All wrong.  They censored and arrested those who stood against the tyranny as they violated human rights.   They were wrong both about the risk — Covid was not nearly as deadly as they claimed, and they were wrong about the measures to deal with it.  No matter how deadly, it’s never legitimate for government to interfere with freedoms in this way. 

Now we should all look back and remember the tyranny and ask why this happened.  Most importantly we must make sure it never happens again.  No matter how deadly a virus the government does not have the right to override the risk preferences of an individual.   They’ve tried to bring back the tyranny with “Omicron” and other efforts and the next pandemic of tyranny may be driven by something else entirely.  But now is the time we can all decide that this will never happen again.  We will not comply.</td>

“The reserve is just Bitcoin - think of it as like a digital Fort Knox for digital gold, we want to put the digital gold in there, we never want to sell it.

We've made the mistake in the past of selling this stuff - at one point in time, we had about 400,000 Bitcoin on the federal balance sheet. 

We sold roughly half of that for something like $360 million total; if we had held all of that, it would be worth over $17 billion.”

Yes Multicoin is a VC, They're the VC that's been all in on Solana since 2018 through good times and bad.

They led the Solana seed round in 2018, when nobody else would.
They led the Solana A in 2019, when nobody else would.
They led the Solana B in 2020, when nobody else would.
They followed on again in 2021, when everyone else wanted in.
And when sol went from all time highs back down to 8$ they held it all because they still believed in Solana when nobody else did. 

Now that that conviction has paid off and they don't need to work a day in their lives anymore Tushar, and Kyle are still in the arena. Whether it's in DC, Park City, NY, SF, or on the Internet, they wake up every day and go to work to ensure Solana wins.

To suggest that this proposal is somehow tainted because people who believe in Solana and want it to succeed this much are involved is absurd.</td>

We enabled trading in USDC on @MyriadMarkets where 2000+ people have placed predictions doing over $50k in volume already.

We made it into the White House (actually insane). 

Our CEO (@loxley_eth) was invited to a Louis Vuitton event at SXSW and his kid won championship basketball 10-12 year old South Central Central Texas championship. 

To top it all off, we gave away a CryptoPunk on @FOMOHOUR!

We are going to win so much and we are never going to get tired of winning.
